<dt>12.2.1</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction prior to any failure or
deterioration of an electronic component of the air conditioning system
that would cause a vehicle's emissions to exceed 1.5 times any of the
appropriate applicable emission standards or would, through software,
effectively disable any other monitored system or component covered by
this regulation. For malfunctions that result in the a lternate control being
erroneously invoked while the A/C system is off, the appropriate emission
standards shall be the FTP standards. For malfunctions that result in the
alternate control failing to be invoked while the A/C system is on, the
appropriate emission standards shall be the SC03 emission standards.</dd>
<dt>12.2.2</dt>
<dd>If no single electronic component failure or deterioration causes
emissions to exceed 1.5 times any of the appropriate applicable emission
standards as defined above in section (e)(12.2.1) nor is used as part of
the diagnostic strategy for any other monitored system or component,
manufacturers are not required to monitor any air conditioning system
component for purposes of section (e)(12).</dd>
