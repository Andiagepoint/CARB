2004 and subsequent model-year vehicles, defined as passenger cars, light-duty
trucks, and medium-duty vehicles, including medium-duty vehicles with engines
certified on an engine dynamometer and medium-duty passenger vehicles, shall be
equipped with an OBD II system and shall meet all applicable requirements of this
