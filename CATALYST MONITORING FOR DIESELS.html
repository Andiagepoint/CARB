(1.5.1)  Requirement: On all 2004 and subsequent model year diesel passenger
cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles (see section (c))
and all 2005 and subsequent model year diesel medium-duty vehicles, the
OBDII system shall monitor the catalyst system for proper conversion
capability.
(1.5.2)  Malfunction Criteria:
(A)  For 2004 and subsequent model year diesel passenger cars, light-duty
trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
(i)  The OBDII system shall detect a catalyst system malfunction when the
catalyst system’s conversion capability decreases to the point that
emissions exceed 1.75 times the applicable FTP full useful life NMHC,
NOx, or PM standard (or, if applicable, NMHC+NOx standard).
(ii)   Except as provided below in section (e)(1.5.2)(A)(iv), if no failure or
deterioration of the catalyst system NMHC conversion capability could
result in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding 1.75 times any of the applicable
standards, the OBDII system shall detect a malfunction when the system
has no detectable amount of NMHC conversion capability.
(iii)   Except as provided below in section (e)(1.5.2)(A)(v), if no failure or
deterioration of the catalyst system NOx conversion capability could result
in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding 1.75 times any of the applicable
standards, the OBDII sy stem shall detect a malfunction when the system
has no detectable amount of NOx conversion capability.
(iv) For the 2004 through 2009 model year, a manufacturer may request to
be exempted from the requirements for NMHC conversion catalyst
system monitoring.  The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated, through data and/or
engineering evaluation, that the average FTP test NMHC conversion
20
efficiency of the system is less than 30 percent (i.e., the cumulative
NMHC emissions measured at the outlet of the catalyst are more than 70
percent of the cumulative engine-out NMHC emissions measured at the
inlet of the catalyst(s)).
(v) For the 2004 through 2009 model year, a manufacturer may request to be
exempted from the requirements for NOx conversion catalyst system
monitoring.  The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated, through data and/or
engineering evaluation, that the average FTP test NOx conversion
efficiency of the system is less than 30 percent (i.e., the cumulative NOx
emissions measured at the outlet of the catalyst are more than 70 percent
of the cumulative engine-out NOx emissions measured at the inlet of the
catalyst(s)).
(B)  For 2005 and 2006 model year diesel medium-duty vehicles (including
medium-duty passenger vehicles certified to an engine dynamometer
tailpipe standard):
(i)  Except as provided below, the OBDII system shall detect a NOx
conversion catalyst system malfunction when the catalyst system’s
conversion capability decreases to the point that emissions exceed 1.75
times the applicable FTP full useful life NOx or PM standard (or, if
applicable, NMHC+NOx standard).
(ii)   A manufacturer may request to be exempted from the requirements for
NOx conversion catalyst system monitoring. The Executive Officer shall
approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer has
demonstrated, through data and/or engineering evaluation, that no failure
or deterioration of the system will cause emissions to exceed the
emission threshold specified in section (e)(1.5.2)(B)(i).
(iii)   Monitoring of the NMHC conversion catalyst system performance is not
required.
(C)  For 2007 and subsequent model year diesel medium-duty vehicles
(including medium-duty passenger vehicles certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe standard):
(i)  The OBDII system shall detect a catalyst system malfunction when the
catalyst system’s conversion capability decreases to the point that
emissions exceed 1.75 times the applicable FTP full useful life NMHC,
NOx, or PM standard (or, if applicable, NMHC+NOx standard).
(ii)   Except as provided below in section (e)(1.5.2)(C)(iv), if no failure or
deterioration of the catalyst system NMHC conversion capability could
result in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding 1.75 times any of the applicable
standards, the OBDII system shall detect a malfunction when the system
has no detectable amount of NMHC conversion capability.
(iii)   Except as provided below in section (e)(1.5.2)(C)(v), if no failure or
deterioration of the catalyst system NOx conversion capability could result
in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding 1.75 times any of the applicable
standards, the OBDII system shall detect a malfunction when the system
has no detectable amount of NOx conversion capability.

(iv) For the 2007 through 2009 model year, a manufacturer may request to
be exempted from the requirements for NMHC conversion catalyst
system monitoring.  The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated, through data and/or
engineering evaluation, that the average FTP test NMHC conversion
efficiency of the system is less than 30 percent (i.e., the cumulative
NMHC emissions measured at the outlet of the catalyst are more than 70
percent of the cumulative engine-out NMHC emissions measured at the
inlet of the catalyst(s)).
(v) For the 2007 through 2009 model year, a manufacturer may request to be
exempted from the requirements for NOx conversion catalyst system
monitoring.  The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated, through data and/or
engineering evaluation, that the average FTP test NOx conversion
efficiency of the system is less than 30 percent (i.e., the cumulative NOx
emissions measured at the outlet of the catalyst are more than 70 percent
of the cumulative engine-out NOx emissions measured at the inlet of the
catalyst(s)).
(1.5.3) Monitoring Conditions: Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions
for malfunctions identified in section (e)(1.5.2) in accordance with sections
(d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements). For purposes of
tracking and reporting as required in section (d)(3.2.2), all monitors used to
detect malfunctions identified in section (e)(1.5.2) shall be tracked separately
but reported as a single set of values as specified in section (d)(5.2.2).
(1.5.4)  MIL Illumination and Fault Code Storage:
(A)  General requirements for MIL illumination and fault code storage are set forth
in section (d)(2).
(B)   The monitoring method for the catalyst(s) shall be capable of detecting all
instances, except diagnostic self-clearing, when a catalyst fault code has
been cleared but the catalyst has not been replaced (e.g., catalyst
overtemperature approaches may not be acceptable).
