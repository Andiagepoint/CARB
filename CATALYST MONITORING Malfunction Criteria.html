(1.2.1) Low Emission Vehicle I applications: The OBDII system shall detect a
catalyst system malfunction when the catalyst system’s conversion capability
decreases to the point that either of the following occurs:
(A)  Non-Methane Organic Gas (NMOG) emissions exceed 1.75 times the FTP
full useful life standards to which the vehicle has been certified with NMOG
emissions multiplied by the certification reactivity adjustment factor for the
vehicle;
(B)  The average FTP test Non-Methane Hydrocarbon (NMHC) conversion
efficiency of the monitored portion of the catalyst system falls below 50
percent (i.e., the cumulative NMHC emissions measured at the outlet of the
monitored catalyst(s) are more than 50 percent of the cumulative engine-out
emissions measured at the inlet of the catalyst(s)).  With Executive Officer
17
approval, manufacturers may use a conversion efficiency malfunction criteria
of less than 50 percent if the catalyst system is designed such that the
monitored portion of the catalyst system must be replaced along with an
adjacent portion of the catalyst system sufficient to ensure that the total
portion replaced will meet the 50 percent conversion efficiency criteria.
Executive Officer approval shall be based on data and/or engineering
evaluation demonstrating the conversion efficiency of the monitored portion
and the total portion designed to be replaced, and the likelihood of the
catalyst system design to ensure replacement of the monitored and adjacent
portions of the catalyst system.
(1.2.2)  Low Emission Vehicle II applications:
(A)   2004 model year vehicles.
(i)  All LEV II, ULEV II, and MDV SULEV II vehicles shall use the malfunction
criteria specified for Low Emission Vehicle I applications in section
(e)(1.2.1).
(ii)  All PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles shall use the malfunction criteria specified
for Low Emission Vehicle I applications in section (e)(1.2.1) except the
malfunction criterion in paragraph (e)(1.2.1)(A) shall be 2.5 times the
applicable FTP full useful life NMOG standard.
(B)   Except as provided below in section (e)(1.2.4), for 2005 and 2006 model
years, the OBDII system shal l detect a catalyst system malfunction when the
catalyst system’s conversion capability decreases to the point that any of the
following occurs:
(i)   For LEV II, ULEV II, and MDV SULEV II vehicles.
a. NMOG emissions exceed the criteria specified for Low Emission
Vehicle I applications in section (e)(1.2.1)(A).
b. The average FTP test NMHC conversion efficiency is below the criteria
specified for Low Emission Vehicle I applications in section
(e)(1.2.1)(B).
c.  Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions exceed 3.5 times the FTP full
useful life NOx standard to which the vehicle has been certified.
(ii)  PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles shall use the same malfunction criteria as
2005 and 2006 model year LEV II, ULEV II, and MDV SULEVII vehicles
(section (e)(1.2.2)(B)(i)) except the malfunction criteria in paragraph a.
shall be 2.5 times the applicable FTP full useful life NMOG standard.
(C)   Except as provided below in section (e)(1.2.5), for 2007 and subsequent
model years, the OBDII system shall detect a catalyst system malfunction
when the catalyst system’s conversion capability decreases to the point that
any of the following occurs.
(i)   For LEV II, ULEV II, and MDV SULEV II vehicles.
a. NMOG emissions exceed the criteria specified for Low Emission
Vehicle I applications in section (e)(1.2.1)(A).
b. The average FTP test NMHC conversion efficiency is below the criteria
specified for Low Emission Vehicle I applications in section
(e)(1.2.1)(B).
18
c. NOx emissions exceed 1.75 times the FTP full useful life NOx standard
to which the vehicle has been certified.
(ii)   For PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles.
a. NMOG emissions exceed 2.5 times the applicable FTP full useful life
NMOG standard to which the vehicle has been certified.
b. The average FTP test NMHC conversion efficiency is below the criteria
specified for Low Emission Vehicle I applications in section
(e)(1.2.1)(B).
c. NOx emissions exceed 2.5 times the applicable FTP full useful life NOx
standard to which the vehicle has been certified.
(1.2.3) Non-Low Emission Vehicle I or II applications: The OBDII system shall detect
a catalyst system malfunction when the catalyst system’s conversion
capability decreases to the point that NMHC emissions increase by more
than 1.5 times the applicable FTP full useful life standards over an FTP test
performed with a representative 4000 mile catalyst system.
(1.2.4) In lieu of using the malfunction criteria in section (e)(1.2.2)(B) for all 2005 and
2006 model year Low Emission Vehicle II applications, a manufacturer may
phase-in the malfunction criteria on a portion of its Low Emission Vehicle II
applications as long as that portion of Low Emission Vehicle II applications
comprises at least 30% of all 2005 model year vehicles and 60% of all 2006
model year vehicles. For 2005 and 2006 model year Low Emission
VehicleII applications not included in the phase-in, the mal function criteria in
section (e)(1.2.2)(A) shall be used.
(1.2.5) In lieu of using the malfunction criteria in section (e)(1.2.2)(C) for all 2007
model year Low Emission Vehicle II applications, for the 2007 model year
only, a manufacturer may continue to use the malfunction criteria in section
(e)(1.2.2)(B) for any Low Emission Vehicle II applications previously certified
in the 2005 or 2006 model year to the malfunction criteria in section
(e)(1.2.2.)(B) and carried over to the 2007 model year.
(1.2.6) For purposes of determining the catalyst system malfunction criteria in
sections (e)(1.2.1), (1.2.2)(A), and (1.2.3), the malfunction criteria shall be
established by using a catalyst system with all monitored catalysts
simultaneously deteriorated to the malfunction criteria while unmonitored
catalysts shall be deteriorated to the end of the vehicle's full useful life.
(1.2.7) For purposes of determining the catalyst system malfunction criteria in
sections (e)(1.2.2)(B) and (C):
(A)  The manufacturer shall use a catalyst system deteriorated to the malfunction
criteria using methods established by the manufacturer to represent real
world catalyst deterioration under normal and malfunctioning operating
conditions.
(B)  Except as provided below in section (e)(1.2.7)(C), the malfunction criteria
shall be established by using a catalyst system with all monitored and
unmonitored (downstream of the sensor utilized for catalyst monitoring)
catalysts simultaneously deteriorated to the malfunction criteria.
(C)  For vehicles using fuel shutoff to prevent over-fueling during misfire
conditions (see section (e)(3.4.1)(D)), the malfunction criteria shall be
19
established by using a catalyst system with all monitored catalysts
simultaneously deteriorated to the malfunction criteria while unmonitored
catalysts shall be deteriorated to the end of the vehicle's full useful life.
