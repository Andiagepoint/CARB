<dd>Low Emission Vehicle I applications: The OBD II system shall detect a
catalyst system malfunction when the catalyst system’s conversion
capability decreases to the point that either of the following occurs:
(A) Non-Methane Organic Gas (NMOG) emissions exceed 1.75 times the
FTP full useful life standards to which the vehicle has been certified with
NMOG emissions multiplied by the certification reactivity adjustment factor
for the vehicle;
(B) The average FTP test Non-Methane Hydrocarbon (NMHC) conversion
efficiency of the monitored portion of the catalyst system falls below 50
percent (i.e., the cumulative NMHC emissions measured at the outlet of
the monitored catalyst(s) are more than 50 percent of the cumulative
engine-out emissions measured at the inlet of the catalyst(s)). With
Executive Officer approval, manufacturers may use a conversion
efficiency malfunction criteria of less than 50 percent if the catalyst system
is designed such that the monitored portion of the catalyst system must be
replaced along with an adjacent portion of the catalyst system sufficient to
ensure that the total portion replaced will meet the 50 percent conversion
efficiency criteria. Executive Officer approval shall be based on data
and/or engineering evaluation demonstrating the conversion efficiency of
the monitored portion and the total portion designed to be replaced, and
the likelihood of the catalyst system design to ensure replacement of the
monitored and adjacent portions of the catalyst system.</dd>

times the applicable FTP full useful life NMOG standard.</li>
<li>Except as provided below in section (e)(1.2.4), for 2005 through 2008

a. NMOG emissions exceed the criteria specified for Low Emission
Vehicle I applications in section (e)(1.2.1)(A).
b. The average FTP test NMHC conversion efficiency is below the
criteria specified for Low Emission Vehicle I applications in section
(e)(1.2.1)(B).
c. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions exceed 3.5 times the FTP full
useful life NOx standard to which the vehicle has been certified.
(ii) PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles shall use the same malfunction criteria as
2005 through 2008 model year LEV II, ULEV II, and MDV SULEV II
vehicles (section (e)(1.2.2)(B)(i)) except the malfunction criteria in
paragraph a. shall be 2.5 times the applicable FTP full useful life
NMOG standard.</li>
<li>Except as provided below in section (e)(1.2.5), for 2009 and subsequent
model years, the OBD II system shall detect a catalyst system malfunction
when the catalyst system’s conversion capability decreases to the point
that any of the following occurs.

<li>For all vehicles other than PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles.
a. NMOG emissions exceed the criteria specified for Low Emission

<dt>1.2.3</dt>
<dd>2004 through 2008 model year non-Low Emission Vehicle I or II
applications: The OBD II system shall detect a catalyst system
malfunction when the catalyst system’s conversion capability decreases to
the point that NMHC emissions increase by more than 1.5 times the
applicable FTP full useful life standards over an FTP test performed with a
representative 4000 mile catalyst system.</dd>
<dt>1.2.4</dt>
<dd>In lieu of using the malfunction criteria in section (e)(1.2.2)(B) for all 2005
and 2006 model year Low Emission Vehicle II applications, a
manufacturer may phase-in the malfunction criteria on a portion of its Low
Emission Vehicle II applications as long as that portion of Low Emission
Vehicle II applications comprises at least 30 percent of all 2005 model
year vehicles and 60 percent of all 2006 model year vehicles. For 2005
and 2006 model year Low Emission Vehicle II applications not included in
the phase-in, the malfunction criteria in section (e)(1.2.2)(A) shall be used.</dd>
<dt>1.2.5</dt>
<dd>In lieu of using the malfunction criteria in section (e)(1.2.2)(C) for all 2009
model year vehicles, for the 2009 model year only, a manufacturer may
continue to use the malfunction criteria in section (e)(1.2.2)(B) for any
vehicles previously certified in the 2005, 2006, 2007, or 2008 model year
to the malfunction criteria in section (e)(1.2.2.)(B) and carried over to the

<dt>1.2.6</dt>
<dd>For purposes of determining the catalyst system malfunction criteria in
sections (e)(1.2.1), (1.2.2)(A), and (1.2.3), the malfunction criteria shall be
established by using a catalyst system with all monitored catalysts
simultaneously deteriorated to the malfunction criteria while unmonitored

represent real world catalyst deterioration under normal and

<li>Except as provided below in section (e)(1.2.7)(C), the malfunction criteria
shall be established by using a catalyst system with all monitored and
unmonitored (downstream of the sensor utilized for catalyst monitoring)
catalysts simultaneously deteriorated to the malfunction criteria.</li>
<li>For vehicles using fuel shutoff to prevent over-fueling during misfire
conditions (see section (e)(3.4.1)(D)), the malfunction criteria shall be
established by using a catalyst system with all monitored catalysts
