(11.2.1) The OBDII system shall detect a malfunction prior to any failure or
deterioration of the individual components associated with the  cold start
emission reduction control strategy that would cause a vehicle’s emissions to
exceed 1.5 times the applicable FTP standards. Manufacturers shall:
(A)  Establish the malfunction criteria based on data from one or more
representative vehicle(s).
(B)   Provide an engineering evaluation for establishing the malfunction criteria for
the remainder of the manufacturer’s product line. The Executive Officer shall
44
waive the evaluation requirement each year if, in the judgement of the
Executive Officer, technological changes do not affect the previously
determined malfunction criteria.
(11.2.2)  For components where no failure or deterioration of the component used for
the cold start emission reduction strategy could result in a vehicle’s
emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standards, the individual
component shall be monitored for proper functional response in accordance
with the malfunction criteria in section (e)(16.2) while the control strategy is
active.
