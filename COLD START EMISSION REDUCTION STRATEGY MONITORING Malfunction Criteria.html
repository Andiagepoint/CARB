<dd>For vehicles not included in the phase-in specified in section (e)(11.2.2):
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction prior to any failure or
deterioration of the individual components associated with the cold start
emission reduction control strategy that would cause a vehicle’s emissions
to exceed 1.5 times the applicable FTP standards. Manufacturers shall:
<ol type=i>
<li>Establish the malfunction criteria based on data from one or more
representative vehicle(s).</li>
<li>Provide an engineering evaluation for establishing the malfunction
criteria for the remainder of the manufacturer’s product line. The
Executive Officer shall waive the evaluation requirement each year if,
in the judgment of the Executive Officer, technological changes do not
affect the previously determined malfunction criteria.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For components where no failure or deterioration of the component used
for the cold start emission reduction strategy could result in a vehicle’s
emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standards, the individual
component shall be monitored for proper functional response in
accordance with the malfunction criteria in section (e)(15.2) while the
control strategy is active.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>11.2.2</dt>
<dd>For 25 percent of 2010, 50 percent of 2011, and 100 percent of 2012
and subsequent model year vehicles, the OBD II system shall, to the
extent feasible, detect a malfunction if either of the following occurs:
<ol type=A>
<li>Any single commanded element does not properly respond to the
commanded action while the cold start strategy is active.  For elements
involving spark timing (e.g., retarded spark timing), the monitor may verify
final commanded spark timing in lieu of verifying actual delivered spark
timing.  For purposes of this section, “properly respond” is defined as
when the element responds:
<ol type=i>
<li>by a robustly detectable amount; and</li>
<li>in the direction of the desired command; and</li>
<li>above and beyond what the element would achieve on start-up without
the cold start strategy active (e.g., if the cold start strategy commands
a higher idle engine speed, a fault must be detected if there is no
detectable amount of engine speed increase above what the system
would achieve without the cold start strategy active);</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Any failure or deterioration of the cold start emission reduction control
strategy that would cause a vehicle’s emissions to be equal to or above
1.5 times the applicable FTP standards. For this requirement, the OBD  II
system shall either monitor elements of the system as a whole (e.g.,
measuring air flow and modeling overall heat into the exhaust) or the
individual elements (e.g., increased engine spee d, commanded final spark
timing) for failures that cause vehicle emissions to exceed 1.5 times the
applicable FTP standards.</li>
