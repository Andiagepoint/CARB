(11.1.1) For all 2006 and subsequent model year Low Emission VehicleII
applications, if a vehicle incorporates a specific engine control strategy to
reduce cold start emissions, the OBDII system shall monitor the key control
or feedback parameters (e.g., engine speed, mass air flow, ignition timing,
etc.), other than secondary air, while the control strategy is active to ensure
proper operation of the control strategy. Secondary air systems shall be
monitored under the provisions of section (e)(5).
(11.1.2) In lieu of meeting the requirements of section (e)(11) on all 2006 and
subsequent model year Low Emission Vehicle II applications, a manufacturer
may phase in the requirements on a portion of its Low Emission Vehicle II
applications as long as that portion of Low Emission Vehicle II applications
comprises at least 30 percent of all 2006 model year vehicles, 60 percent of
all 2007 model year vehicles, and 100 percent of all 2008 and subsequent
model year vehicles.
