<dd>Except as provided in section (e)(15.4.2) below, general requirements for
MIL illumination and fault code storage are set forth in section (d)(2).</dd>
<dt>15.4.2</dt>
<dd>Exceptions to general requirements for MIL illumination. MIL illumination
is not required in conjunction with storing a confirmed fault code for any
comprehensive component if:
<ol type=A>
<li>the component or system, when malfunctioning, could not cause vehicle
emissions to increase by:
<ol type=i>
<li>25 percent or more for PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles, or</li>
<li>15 percent or more for all other vehicles, and</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>the component or system is not used as part of the diagnostic strategy for
any other monitored system or component.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>15.4.3</dt>
<dd>For purposes of determining the emission increase in section
(e)(15.4.2)(A), the manufacturer shall request Executive Officer approval
of the test cycle/vehicle operating conditions for which the emission
increase will be determined. Executive Officer approval shall be granted
upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or
engineering evaluation that demonstrate that the testing conditions
represent in-use driving conditions where emissions are likely to be most
affected by the malfunctioning component. For purposes of determining
whether the specified percentages in section (e)(15.4.2)(A) are exceeded,
if the approved testing conditions are comprised of an emission test cycle
with an exhaust emission standard, the measured increase shall be
compared to a percentage of the exhaust emission standard (e.g., if the
increase is equal to or more than 15  percent of the exhaust emission
standard for that test cycle). If the approved testing conditions are
comprised of a test cycle or vehicle operating condition that does not have
an exhaust emission standard, the measured increase shall be calculated
as a percentage of the baseline test (e.g., if the increase from a back-toback test sequence between normal and malfunctioning condition is equal
to or more than 15 percent of the baseline test results from the normal
condition).</dd>
