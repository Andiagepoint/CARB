<dd>Input Components:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect malfunctions of input components caused
by a lack of circuit continuity, out of range values, and, where feasible,
rationality faults. To the extent feasible, the rationality fault diagnostics
shall verify that a sensor output is neither inappropriately high nor
inappropriately low (e.g., “two-sided” diagnostics).</li>
<li>To the extent feasible on all 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles,
rationality faults shall be separately detected and store different fault
codes than the respective lack of circuit continuity and out of range
diagnostics. Additionally, input component lack of circuit continuity and
out of range faults shall be separately detected and store different fault
codes for each distinct malfunction (e.g., out-of-range low, out-of-range
high, open circuit, etc.). Manufacturers are not required to store separate
fault codes for lack of circuit continuity faults that cannot be distinguished
from other out-of-range circuit faults.</li>
<li>For vehicles that require precise alignment between the camshaft and the
crankshaft, the OBD II system shall monitor the crankshaft position
sensor(s) and camshaft position sensor(s) to verify proper alignment
between the camshaft and crankshaft in addition to monitoring the
sensors for circuit continuity and rationality malfunctions. Proper
alignment monitoring between a camshaft and a crankshaft shall only be
required in cases where both are equipped with position sensors. For
2006 through 2008 model year Low Emission Vehicle II applications and
all 2009 and subsequent model year vehicles equipped with VVT systems
and a timing belt or chain, the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction if
the alignment between the camshaft and crankshaft is off by one or more
cam/crank sprocket cogs (e.g., the timing belt/chain has slipped by one or
more teeth/cogs). If a manufacturer demonstrates that a single tooth/cog
misalignment cannot cause a measurable increase in emissions during
any reasonable driving condition, the manufacturer shall detect a
malfunction when the minimum number of teeth/cogs misalignment
needed to cause a measurable emission increase has occurred. For the
2006 through 2009 model years only, a manufacturer may also request
Executive Officer approval to use a larger threshold than one tooth/cog.
The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the
manufacturer has demonstrated that hardware modifications are
necessary to meet the one tooth/cog threshold and that further software
modifications are not able to reduce the larger threshold.</li>

<dd>Output Components/Systems:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of an output
component/system when proper functional response of the component
and system to computer commands does not occur. If a functional check
is not feasible, the OBD II system shall detect malfunctions of output
components/systems caused by a lack of circuit continuity or circuit fault
(e.g., short to ground or high voltage). For output component lack of
circuit continuity faults and circuit faults, manufacturers are not required to
store different fault codes for each distinct malfunction (e.g., open circuit,
shorted low, etc.). Manufacturers are not required to activate an output
component/system when it would not normally be active for the purposes
of performing functional monitoring of output components/systems as
required in section (e)(15).</li>
<li>The idle speed control system shall be monitored for proper functional
response to computer commands. For strategies based on deviation from
target idle speed, a malfunction shall be det ected when either of the
following conditions occur:
<ol type=i>
<li>The idle speed control system cannot achieve the target idle speed
within 200 revolutions per minute (rpm) above the target speed or 100
rpm below the target speed. The Executive Officer shall allow lar ger
engine speed tolerances upon determining that a manufacturer has
submitted data and/or an engineering evaluation which demonstrate
that the tolerances can be exceeded without a malfunction being
present.</li>
<li>The idle speed control system cannot achieve the target idle speed
within the smallest engine speed tolerance range required by the
OBD II system to enable any other monitor.</li>
