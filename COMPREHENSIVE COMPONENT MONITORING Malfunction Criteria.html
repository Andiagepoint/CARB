(16.2.1)  Input Components:
(A)  The OBDII system shall detect malfunctions of input components caused by
a lack of circuit continuity, out of range values, and, where feasible, rationality
faults. To the extent feasible, the rationality fault diagnostics shall verify that a
sensor output is neither inappropriately high nor inappropriately low (e.g.,
“two-sided” diagnostics).
(B)   To the extent feasible on all 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles,
rationality faults shall be separately detected and store different fault codes
than the respective lack of circuit continuity and out of range diagnostics.
Additionally, input component lack of circuit continuity and out of range faults
shall be separately detected and store different fault codes for each distinct
malfunction (e.g., out-of-range low, out-of-range high, open circuit, etc.).
Manufacturers are not required to store separate fault codes for lack of
circuit continuity faults that cannot be distinguished from other out-of-range
circuit faults.
(C)  For vehicles that require precise alignment between the camshaft and the
crankshaft, the OBD II system shall monitor the crankshaft position sensor(s)
and camshaft position sensor(s) to verify proper alignment between the
camshaft and crankshaft in addition to monitoring the sensors for circuit
continuity and rationality malfunctions. Proper alignment monitoring between
a camshaft and a crankshaft shall only be required in cases where both are
equipped with position sensors.  For 2006 and subsequent model year Low
Emission Vehicle II applications equipped with VVT systems and a timing
belt or chain, the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction if the alignment
between the camshaft and crankshaft is off by one or more cam/crank
sprocket cogs (e.g., the timing belt/chain has slipped by one or more
teeth/cogs). If a manufacturer demonstrates that a single tooth/cog
misalignment cannot cause a measurable increase in emissions during any
reasonable driving condition, the manufacturer shall detect a malfunction
when the minimum number of teeth/cogs misalignment needed to cause a
measurable emission increase has occurred. For the 2006 through 2008
model years only, a manufacturer may also request Executive Officer
approval to use a larger threshold than one tooth/cog. The Executive Officer
shall approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer has
demonstrated that hardware modifications are necessary to meet the  one
tooth/cog threshold and that further software modifications are not able to
reduce the larger threshold.
(16.2.2)  Output Components/Systems:
(A)  The OBDII system shall detect a malfunction of an output component/system
when proper functional response of the component and system to computer
commands does not occur. If a functional check is not feasible, the OBDII
system shall detect malfunctions of output components/systems caused by a
lack of circuit continuity or circuit fault (e.g., short to ground or high voltage).
For output component lack of circuit continuity faults and circuit faults,
manufacturers are not required to store different fault codes for each distinct
50
malfunction (e.g., open circuit, shorted low, etc.). Manufacturers are not
required to activate an output component/system when it would not normally
be active exclusively for the purposes of performing functional monitoring of
output components/systems as required in section (e)(16).
(B)   The idle speed control system shall be monitored for proper functional
response to computer commands. For strategies based on deviation from
target idle speed, a malfunction shall be detected when either of the following
conditions occur:
(i)  The idle speed control system cannot achieve the target idle speed within
200 revolutions per minute (rpm) above the target speed or 100 rpm
below the target speed. The Executive Officer shall allow larger engine
speed tolerances upon determining that a manufacturer has submitted
data and/or an engineering  evaluation which demonstrate that the
tolerances can be exceeded without a malfunction being present.
(ii)  The idle speed control system cannot achieve the target idle speed within
the smallest engine speed tolerance range required by the OBDII system
to enable any other monitors.
(C)   Glow plugs shall be monitored for proper functional response to computer
commands. The glow plug circuit(s) shall be monitored for proper current
and voltage drop. The Executive Officer shall approve other monitoring
strategies based on manufacturer’s data and/or engineering analysis
demonstrating equally reliable and timely detection of malfunctions.
Manufacturers shall detect a malfunction when a single glow plug no longer
operates within the manufacturer’s specified limits for normal operation. If a
manufacturer demonstrates that a single glow plug failure cannot cause a
measurable increase in emissions during any reasonable driving condition,
the manufacturer shall detect a malfunction for the minimum number of glow
plugs needed to cause an emission increase. Further, to the extent feasible
on existing engine designs (without adding additional hardware for this
purpose) and on all new design engines, the stored fault code shall identify
the specific malfunctioning glow plug(s).
