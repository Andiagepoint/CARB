(16.3.1)  Input Components:
(A)  Except as provided in section (e)(16.3.1)(C), input components shall be
monitored continuously for proper range of values and circuit continuity.
(B)   For rationality monitoring (where applicable):
(i)  For 2004 model year vehicles, manufacturers shall define the monitoring
conditions for detecting malfunctions in accordance with section (d)(3.1).
(ii)   For 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles, manufacturers shall
define the monitoring conditions for detecting malfunctions in accordance
with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements), with
the exception that rationality monitoring shall occur every time the
monitoring conditions are met during the driving cycle in lieu of once per
driving cycle as required in section (d)(3.1.2).
(C)  A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable
continuous input component proper range of values or circuit continuity

monitoring when a malfunction cannot be distinguished from other effects.
The Executive Officer shall approve the disablement upon determining that
the manufacturer has submitted test data and/or documentation that
demonstrate a properly functioning input component cannot be distinguished
from a malfunctioning input component and that the disablement interval is
limited only to that necessary for avoiding false detection.
(16.3.2)  Output Components/Systems:
(A)  Except as provided in section (e)(16.3.2)(D), monitoring for circuit continuity
and circuit faults shall be conducted continuously.
(B)   Except as provided in section (e)(16.3.2)(C), for functional monitoring,
manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for detecting
malfunctions in accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum
ratio requirements).
(C)   For the idle speed control system on all 2005 and subsequent model year
vehicles, manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for functional
monitoring in accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum
ratio requirements), with the exception that functional monitoring shall occur
every time the monitoring conditions are met during the driving cycle in lieu of
once per driving cycle as required in section (d)(3.1.2).
(D)  A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable
continuous output component circuit continuity or circuit fault monitoring when
a malfunction cannot be distinguished from other effects. The Executive
Officer shall approve the disablement upon determining that the manufacturer
has submitted test data and/or documentation that demonstrate a properly
functioning output component cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning
output component and that the disablement interval is limited only to that
necessary for avoiding false detection.
