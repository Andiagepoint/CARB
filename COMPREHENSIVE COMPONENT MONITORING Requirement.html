<dt>15.1.1</dt>
<dd>Except as provided in sections (e)(15.1.3), (e)(15.1.4), and (e)(16), the
OBD II system shall monitor for malfunction any electronic powertrain
component/system not otherwise described in sections (e)(1) through
(e)(14) that either provides input to (directly or indirectly) or receives
commands from the on-board computer(s), and: (1) can affect emissions
during any reasonable in-use driving condition, or (2) is used as part of
the diagnostic strategy for any other monitored system or component.
(A) Input Components: Input components required to be mo nitored may
include the vehicle speed sensor, crank angle sensor, knock sensor,
throttle position sensor, cam position sensor, fuel composition sensor (e.g.
flexible fuel vehicles), and transmission electronic components such as
sensors, modules, and solenoids which provide signals to the powertrain
control system.
(B) Output Components/Systems: Output components/systems required to be
monitored may include the idle speed control system, automatic
transmission solenoids or controls, variable length intake manif old runner
58
systems, supercharger or turbocharger electronic components, heated
fuel preparation systems, and a warm-up catalyst bypass valve.</dd>
<dt>15.1.2</dt>
<dd>For purposes of criteria (1) in section (e)(15.1.1) above, the manufacturer
shall determine whether a powertrain input or output component/system
can affect emissions. If the Executive Officer reasonably believes that a
manufacturer has incorrectly determined that a component/system cannot
affect emissions, the Executive Officer shall require the manufacturer to
provide emission data showing that the component/system, when
malfunctioning and installed in a suitable test vehicle, does not have an
emission effect.  The Executive Officer may request emission data for any
reasonable driving condition.</dd>
<dt>15.1.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall monitor for malfunction electronic powertrain input or
output components/systems associated with an electronic transfer case,
electronic power steering system, or other components that are driven by
the engine and not related to the control of fueling, air  handling, or
emissions only if the component or system is used as part of the
diagnostic strategy for any other monitored system or component.</dd>
<dt>15.1.4</dt>
<dd>Except as specified for hybrids in section (e)(15.1.5), manufacturers shall
monitor for malfunction electronic powertrain input or output
components/systems associated with components that only affect
emissions by causing additional electrical load to the engine and are not
related to the control of fueling, air handling, or emissions only if the
component or system is used as part of the diagnostic strategy for any
other monitored system or component.</dd>
<dt>15.1.5</dt>
<dd>For hybrids, manufacturers shall submit a plan to the Executive Officer
for approval of the hybrid components  determined by the manufacturer to
be subject to monitoring in section (e)(15.1.1). In general, the Executive
Officer shall approve the plan if it includes monitoring of all
components/systems used as part of the diagnostic strategy for any other
monitored system or component, monitoring of all energy input devices to
the electrical propulsion system, monitoring of battery and charging
system performance, monitoring of electric motor performance, and
monitoring of regenerative braking performance.</dd>
