(16.1.1) Except as provided in section (e)(16.1.3) and (e)(17), the OBDII system
shall monitor for malfunction any electronic powertrain component/system not
otherwise described in sections (e)(1) through (e)(15) that either provides
input to (directly or indirectly) or receives commands from the on-board
computer(s), and: (1) can affect emissions during any reasonable in-use
driving condition, or (2) is used as part of the diagnostic strategy for any
other monitored system or component.
48
(A)  Input Components: Input components required to be monitored may include
the vehicle speed sensor, crank angle sensor, knock sensor, throttle position
sensor, cam position sensor, fuel composition sensor (e.g. flexible fuel
vehicles), and transmission electronic components such as sensors,
modules, and solenoids which provide signals to the  powertrain control
system.
(B)  Output Components/Systems: Output components/systems required to be
monitored may include the idle speed control system, automatic
transmission solenoids or controls, variable length intake manifold runner
systems, supercharger or turbocharger electronic components, heated fuel
preparation systems, the wait-to-start lamp on diesel applications, and a
warm-up catalyst bypass valve.
(16.1.2)  For purposes of criteria (1) in section (e)(16.1.1) above, the manufacturer
shall determine whether a  powertrain input or output component/system can
affect emissions. If the Executive Officer reasonably believes that a
manufacturer has incorrectly determined that a component/system cannot
affect emissions, the Executive Officer shall require the manufacturer to
provide emission data showing that the component/system, when
malfunctioning and installed in a suitable test vehicle, does not have an
emission effect. Emission data may be requested for any reasonable driving
condition.
(16.1.3)  Manufacturers shall monitor for malfunction electronic powertrain input or
output components/systems associated with an electronic transfer case only
if the transfer case component or system is used as part of the diagnostic
strategy for any other monitored system or component.
