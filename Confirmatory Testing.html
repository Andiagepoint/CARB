(6.1)  The ARB may perform confirmatory testing to verify the emission test data
submitted by the manufacturer under the requirements of section (g) comply with
the requirements of section (g) and the malfunction criteria identified in section
(e). This confirmatory testing is limited to the vehicle configuration represented
by the demonstration vehicle(s). For purposes of section (g)(6), vehicle
configuration shall have the same meaning as the term used in 40 CFR 86.082-2.
(6.2)  The ARB or its designee may install appropriately deteriorated or malfunctioning
components in an otherwise properly functioning test vehicle of a test group
represented by the demonstration test vehicle(s) (or simulate a deteriorated or
malfunctioning component) in order to test any of the components or systems
70
required to be tested in section (g). Upon request by the Executive Officer, the
manufacturer shall make available a vehicle and all test equipment (e.g.,
malfunction simulators, deteriorated components, etc.) necessary to duplicate
the manufacturer’s testing. The Executive Officer shall make the request within
six months of reviewing and approving the demonstration test vehicle data
submitted by the manufacturer for the specific test group.
(6.3)  Vehicles with OBDII systems represented by the demonstration vehicle(s) may
be recalled for corrective action if a representative sample of vehicles uniformly
fails to meet the requirements of section (g).
