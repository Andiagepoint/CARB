<dt>10.2.1</dt>
<dd>For the purposes of section (f)(10), “CV system” is defined as any form of
crankcase ventilation system, regardless of whether it utilizes positive
pressure or whether it vents to the atmosphere, the intake, or the exhaust.
“CV valve” is defined as any form of valve, orifice, or filter/separator used
to restrict, control, or alter the composition (e.g., remove oil vapor or
particulate matter) of the crankcase vapor flow. Further, any additional
external CV system tubing or hoses used to equalize crankcase pressure
or to provide a ventilation path between various areas of the engine (e.g.,
crankcase and valve cover) are considered part of the CV system
“between the crankcase and the CV valve” and subject to the malfunction
criteria in section (f)(10.2.2) below.</dd>
<dt>10.2.2</dt>
<dd>Except as provided below, the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction
of the CV system when a disconnection of the system occurs between
either the crankcase and the CV valve, or between the CV valve and the
intake ducting.</dd>
<dt>10.2.3</dt>
<dd>If disconnection in the system results in a rapid loss of oil or other overt
indication of a CV system malfunction  such that the vehicle operator is
certain to respond and have the vehicle repaired, the Executive Officer
shall exempt the manufacturer from detection of that disconnection.</dd>
<dt>10.2.4</dt>
<dd>Detection of a disconnection is not required if the disconnection cannot
be made without first disconnecting a monitored portion of the system
(e.g., the CV system is designed such that the CV valve is fastened
directly to the crankcase in a manner which makes it significantly more
difficult to remove the valve from the crankcase before disconnecting the
line between the valve and the intake ducting (taking aging effects into
consideration) and the line between the valve and the intake ducting is
monitored for disconnection).</dd>
<dt>10.2.5</dt>
<dd>Subject to Executive Officer approval, system designs that utilize tubing
between the valve and the crankcase shall also be exempted from the
monitoring requirement for detection of disconnection between the
crankcase and the CV valve.  The manufacturer shall file a request and
submit data and/or engineering evaluation in support of the request. The
Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the
101
connections between the valve and the crankcase are: (i) resistant to
deterioration or accidental disconnection, (ii) significantly more difficult to
disconnect than the line between the valve and the intake ducting, and (iii)
not subject to disconnection per manufacturer’s maintenance, service,
and/or repair procedures for non-CV system repair work</dd>
<dt>10.2.6</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers are not required to detect disconnections that are unlikely
to occur due to a CV system design that is integral to the induction system
(e.g., internal machined passages rather than tubing or hoses).</dd>
<dt>10.2.7</dt>
<dd>For medium-duty vehicles with engines certified on an engine
dynamometer having an open CV system (i.e., a system that releases
crankcase emissions to the atmosphere without routing them to the intake
ducting or to the exhaust upstream of the aftertreatment), the
manufacturer shall submit a plan for Executive Officer approval of the
monitoring strategy, malfunction criteria, and monitoring conditions prior to
OBD certification. Executive Officer approval shall be based on the
effectiveness of the monitoring strategy to (i) monitor the performance of
the CV system to the extent feasible with respect to the malfunctio n
criteria in section (f)(10.2.1) through (f)(10.2.4) and the monitoring
conditions required by the diagnostic, and (ii) monitor the ability of the CV
system to control crankcase vapor emitted to the atmosphere relative to
the manufacturer’s design and performance specifications for a properly
functioning system (e.g., if the system is equipped with a filter  and/or
separator to reduce crankcase emissions to the atmosphere, the OBD II
system shall monitor the integrity of the filter and/or function of the
separator)</dd>
