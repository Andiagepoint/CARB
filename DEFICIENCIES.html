<li>For 2004 and subsequent model year vehicles, the Executive Officer, upon
receipt of an application from the manufacturer, may certify vehicles even though
said vehicles may not comply with one or more of the requirements of title 13,
CCR section 1968.2. In granting the certification, the Executive Officer shall
consider the following factors: the extent to which the requirements of section
1968.2 are satisfied overall based on a review of the vehicle applications in
question, the relative performance of the resultant OBD II system compared to
systems fully compliant with the requirements of title 13, CCR section 1968.2,
and a demonstrated good-faith effort on the part of the manufacturer to: (1) meet
the requirements in full by evaluating and considering the best available
monitoring technology; and (2) come into compliance as expeditiously as
possible. The Executive Officer may not grant certification to a vehicle in which
the reported noncompliance for which a deficiency is sought would be subject t o
ordered recall pursuant to section 1968.5 (c)(3)(A).</li>
<li>Manufacturers of non-complying systems are subject to fines pursuant to section
43016 of the California Health and Safety Code.  Except as allowed in section
(k)(7) for light-duty and medium-duty diesel vehicles, the specified fines apply to
the third and subsequently identified deficiencies, with the exception that fines
shall apply to all monitoring system deficiencies wherein a required monitoring
strategy is completely absent from the OBD system.</li>
<li>The fines are in the amount of $50 per deficiency per vehicle for non-compliance
with any of the monitoring requirements specified in sections (e)(1) through
(e)(8), (e)(11), (e)(13)(e)(14), (e)(16), (f)(1) through (f)(9), (f)(13), and (f)(16) and
$25 per deficiency per vehicle for non-compliance with any other requirement of
section 1968.2. In determining the identified order of deficiencies, deficiencies
subject to a $50 fine are identified first. Total fines per vehicle under section (k)
may not exceed $500 per vehicle and are payable to the State Treasurer for
deposit in the Air Pollution Control Fund.</li>
<li>Manufacturers must re-apply for Executive Officer approval of a deficiency each
model year. In considering the request to carry-over a deficiency, the Executive
Officer shall consider the factors identified in section (k)(1) including the
manufacturer’s progress towards correcting the deficiency.  For all deficiencies
except for deficiencies associated with PM filter monitoring section (f)(9.2.1)(A),
the Executive Officer may not allow manufacturers to carry over monitoring
system deficiencies for more than two model years unless it can be
demonstrated that substantial vehicle hardware modifications and additional lead
time beyond two years would be necessary to correct the deficiency, in which
case the Executive Officer shall allow the deficiency to be carried over for three
model years.  For deficiencies associated with PM filter monitoring section
(f)(9.2.1)(A), if the manufacturer can demonstrate that su bstantial vehicle
hardware modifications and additional lead time would be necessary to correct
the deficiency, the Executive shall allow the deficiency to be carried over up to
and including the 2013 model year.</li>
<li>Except as allowed in section (k)(6), deficiencies may not be retroactively granted
after certification.</li>
<li>Request for retroactive deficiencies
<dl>
<dt>6.1</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request that the Executive Officer grant a deficiency and
amend a vehicle’s certification to conform to the granting of the deficiencies
during the first 6 months after commencement of normal production for each
aspect of the monitoring system: (a) identified by the manufacturer (during
testing required by section (j)(2) or any other testing) to be functioning
different than the certified system or otherwise not meeting the requirements
of any aspect of section 1968.2; and (b) reported to the Executive Officer. If
the Executive Officer grants the deficiencies and amended certification, their
approval would be retroactive to the start of production.</dd>
<dt>6.2</dt>
<dd>Executive Officer approval of the request for a retroactive deficiency shall be
granted provided that the conditions necessary for a pre-certification
deficiency determination are satisfied (see section (k)(1)) and the
manufacturer could not have reasonably anticipated the identified problem
before commencement of production.</dd>
<dt>6.3</dt>
<dd>In granting the amended certification, the Executive Officer shall include any
approved post-production deficiencies together with all previously approved
deficiencies in computing fines in accordance with section (k)(2).</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Exceptions to Fines Requirements.
<dl>
<dt>7.1</dt>
<dd>For 2007 through 2009 model year light-duty and 2007 through 2012 model
year medium-duty diesel vehicles, in cases where one or more of the
deficiencies is for the aftertreatment monitoring requirements of sections
(f)(1), (2), (8), or (9) and the deficient monitor is properly able to detect all
malfunctions prior to emissions exceeding twice the required monitor
threshold (e.g., before emissions exceed 10 times the standard for  NMHC if
the threshold is 5.0 times the standard for NMHC), the specified fines shall
apply to the fourth and subsequently identified deficiencies  in lieu of the third
and subsequently identified deficiencies. If none of the deficiencies are for
the requirements of sections (f)(1), (2), (8), or (9) or if the deficient
aftertreatment monitor exceeds twice the required monitor threshold, the
specified fines shall apply to the third and subsequently identified
deficiencies. In all cases, the exception that fines shall apply to all monitoring
system deficiencies wherein a required monitoring strategy is completely
absent from the OBD system still applies.</dd>
<dt>7.2</dt>
<dd>For 2013 through 2014 model year light-duty and medium-duty diesel
vehicles that utilize PM sensors for PM filter filtering performance monitoring
(section (f)(9.2.1)(A)), in cases where the deficiency is for a monitor required
to detect malfunctions of the PM filter filtering performance (section
(f)(9.2.1)(A)), the PM sensor (section (f)(5.2.2)), or the PM se nsor heater
(section (f)(5.2.4)), the deficiency shall be exempt from the specified fines of
section (k)(3) and the deficiency shall not be included in the count of
deficiencies used in (k)(2) to determine the number of deficiencies subject to
fines.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Any OBD II system installed on a production vehicle that fails to conform with the
certified OBD II system for that vehicle or otherwise fails to meet the
requirements of section 1968.2 and has not been granted a deficiency pursuant
to the provisions of section (k)(1) through (k)(7) are considered non-compliant.
The vehicles are subject to enforcement pursuant to applicable provisions of the
Health and Safety Code and title 13, CCR section 1968.5.</li>
