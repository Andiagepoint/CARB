(1)  For 2004 and subsequent model year vehicles, the Executive Officer, upon receipt
of an application from the manufacturer, may certify vehicles even though said
vehicles may not comply with one or more of the requirements of title 13, CCR
section 1968.2.  In granting the certification, the Executive Officer shall consider the
following factors: the extent to which the requirements of section 1968.2 are
satisfied overall based on a review of the vehicle applications in question, the
relative performance of the resultant OBDII system compared to systems fully
compliant with the requirements of title 13, CCR section 1968.2, and a
demonstrated good-faith effort on the part of the manufacturer to: (1) meet the
requirements in full by evaluating and considering the best available monitoring
technology; and (2) come into compliance as expeditiously as possible. The
Executive Officer may not grant certification to a vehicle in which the reported
noncompliance for which a deficiency is sought would be subject to ordered recall
pursuant to section 1968.5 (c)(3)(A).
(2)  Manufacturers of non-complying systems are subject to fines pursuant to section
43016 of the California Health and Safety Code. The specified fines apply to the
third and subsequently identified deficiencies, with the exception that fines shall
apply to all monitoring system deficiencies wherein a required monitoring strategy is
completely absent from the OBD system.
(3)  The fines are in the amount of $50 per deficiency per vehicle for non-compliance
with any of the monitoring requirements specified in sections (e)(1) through (e)(8),
(e)(11), (e)(13) through (e)(15), and (e)(17), and $25 per deficiency per vehicle for
non-compliance with any other requirement of section 1968.2. In determining the
identified order of deficiencies, deficiencies subject to a $50 fine are identified first.
Total fines per vehicle under section (i) may not exceed $500 per vehicle and are
payable to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Air Pollution Control Fund.
(4)  Manufacturers must re-apply for Executive Officer approval of a deficiency each
model year. In considering the request to carry-over a deficiency, the Executive
Officer shall consider the factors identified in section (i)(1) including the
manufacturer’s progress towards correcting the deficiency.  The Executive Officer
may not allow manufacturers to carry over monitoring system deficiencies for more
than two model years unless it can be demonstrated that substantial vehicle
hardware modifications and additional lead time beyond two years would be
necessary to correct the deficiency, in which case the Executive Officer shall allow
the deficiency to be carried over for three model years.
(5)  Except as allowed in section (i)(6), deficiencies may not be retroactively granted
after certification.

(6)  Request for retroactive deficiencies
(6.1)  Manufacturers may request that the Executive Officer grant a deficiency and
amend a vehicle’s certification to conform to the granting of the deficiencies
during the first 6 months after commencement of normal production for each
aspect of the monitoring system: (a) identified by the manufacturer (during
testing required by section (j)(2) or any other testing) to be functioning different
than the certified system or otherwise not meeting the requirements of any
aspect of section 1968.2; and (b) reported to the Executive Officer. If the
Executive Officer grants the deficiencies and amended certification, their
approval would be retroactive to the start of production.
(6.2)  Executive Officer approval of the request for a retroactive deficiency shall be
granted provided that the conditions necessary for a pre-certification deficiency
determination are satisfied (see section (i)(1)) and the manufacturer could not
have reasonably anticipated the identified problem before commencement of
production.
(6.3)  In granting the amended certification, the Executive Officer shall include any
approved post-production deficiencies together with all previously approved
deficiencies in computing fines in accordance with section (i)(2).
(7)  Any OBDII system installed on a production vehicle that fails to conform with the
certified OBDII system for that vehicle or otherwise fails to meet the requ irements of
section 1968.2 and has not been granted a deficiency pursuant to the provisions of
section (i )(1) through (i )(6) are considered non-compliant. The vehicles are subject
to enforcement pursuant to applicable provisions of the Health and Safety Code and
title 13, CCR section 1968.5.
