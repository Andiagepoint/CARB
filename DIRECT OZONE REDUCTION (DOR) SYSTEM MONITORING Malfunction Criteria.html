(14.2.1) For vehicles in which the NMOG credit assigned to the DOR system, as
calculated in accordance with ARB MAC No. 99-06, is less than or equal to
50 percent of the applicable FTP NMOG standard, the OBDII system shall
detect a malfunction when the DOR system has no detectable amount of
ozone reduction.
(14.2.2) For vehicles in which the NMOG credit assigned to the DOR system, as
calculated in accordance with ARB MAC No. 99-06, is greater than 50
percent of the applicable FTP NMOG standard, the OBDII system shall
detect a malfunction when the ozone reduction performance of the DOR
system deteriorates to a point where the difference between the NMOG
credit assigned to the properly operating DOR system and the NMOG credit
calculated for a DOR system performing at the level of the malfunctioning
system exceeds 50 percent of the applicable FTP NMOG standard.
(14.2.3) For vehicles equipped with a DOR system, the manufacturer may modify
any of the applicable NMOG malfunction criteria in sections (e)(1)-(3), (e)(5)-(8), (e)(11)-(e)(13), and (e)(17) by adding the NMOG credit received by the
DOR system to the required NMOG malfunction criteria (e.g., a malfunction
criteria of 1.5 x NMOG standard would be modified to (1.5 x NMOG
standard) + DOR system NMOG credit).
