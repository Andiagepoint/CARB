The following signals shall be made available on demand
through the standardized data link connector in accordance with SAE J1979

<dd>For all vehicles: calculated load value, number of stored confirmed fault
codes, engine coolant temperature, engine speed, absolute throttle
position (if equipped with a throttle), vehicle speed, OBD requirements to
which the engine is certified (e.g., California OBD II, EPA OBD, European
OBD, non-OBD) and MIL status (i.e., commanded-on or commanded-off).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.2.2</dt>
<dd>For all vehicles so equipped: fuel control system status (e.g., open loop,
closed loop, etc.), fuel trim, fuel pressure, ignition timing advance, intake
air temperature, manifold absolute pressure, air flow rate from mass air
flow sensor, secondary air status (upstream, downstream, or
atmosphere), oxygen sensor output, air/fuel ratio sensor output.</dd>

<dd>For all 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles using the ISO 15765-4
protocol for the standardized functions required in section (g), the
following signals shall also be made available: absolute load, fuel level (if
used to enable or disable any other diagnostics), relative throttle position
(if equipped with a throttle), barometric pressure (directly measured or
estimated), engine control module system voltage, commanded
equivalence ratio, catalyst temperature (if directly measured or estimated
for purposes of enabling the catalyst monitor(s)), monitor status (i.e.,
disabled for the rest of this driving cycle, complete this driving cycle, or not
complete this driving cycle) since last engine shut-off for each monitor
used for readiness status, time elapsed since engine start, distance
traveled while MIL activated, distance traveled since fault memory last
cleared, and number of warm-up cycles since fault memory last cleared.</dd>
