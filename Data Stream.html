The following signals shall be made available on demand through
the standardized data link connector in accordance with SAE J1979
specifications. The actual signal value shall always be used instead of a default
or limp home value.
<dl>
<dt>4.2.1</dt>
<dd>For all vehicles: calculated load value, number of stored confirmed fault
codes, engine coolant temperature, engine speed, absolute throttle position
(if equipped with a throttle), vehicle speed, and MIL status (i.e., commandedon or commanded-off).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.2.2</dt>
<dd>For all vehicles so equipped: fuel control system status (e.g., open loop,
closed loop, etc.), fuel trim, fuel pressure, ignition timing advance, intake air
temperature, manifold absolute pressure, air flow rate from mass air flow
sensor, secondary air status (upstream, downstream, or atmosphere),
oxygen sensor output, air/fuel ratio sensor output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.2.3</dt>
<dd>For all 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles using the ISO 15765-4
protocol for the standardized functions required in section (f), the following
signals shall also be made available: absolute load, fuel level (if used to
enable or disable any other diagnostics), relative throttle position (if
equipped with a throttle), barometric pressure (directly measured or
estimated), engine control module system voltage, commanded equivalence
ratio, catalyst temperature (if directly measured or estimated for purposes of
enabling the catalyst monitor(s)), monitor status (i.e., disabled for the rest of
this driving cycle, complete this driving cycle, or not complete this driving
cycle) since last engine shut-off for each monitor used for readiness status,
time elapsed since engine start, distance traveled while MIL activated,
distance traveled since fault memory last cleared, and number of warm-up
cycles since fault memory last cleared.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.2.4</dt>
<dd>For all 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles so equipped and using the
ISO 15765-4 protocol for the standardized functions required in section (f):
ambient air temperature, evaporative system vapor pressure, commanded
purge valve duty cycle/position, commanded EGR valve duty cycle/position,
EGR error between actual and commanded, PTO status (active or not
active), redundant absolute throttle position (for electronic throttle or other
systems that utilize two or more sensors), absolute pedal position, redundant
absolute pedal position, and commanded throttle motor position.</dd>
