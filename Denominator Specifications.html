<dt>4.3.2</dt>
<dd>Specifications for incrementing:
<ol type=A>
<li>TThe denominator, when incremented, shall be incremented by an integer
of one. The denominator may not be incremented more than once per
driving cycle.</li>
<li>Except as provided for in sections (d)(4.3.2)(H), (J), and (K), the
denominator for each monitor shall be incremented within ten seconds if
and only if the following criteria are satisfied on a single driving cycle:
<ol type=i>
<li>TCumulative time since engine start is greater than or equal to 600
seconds while at an elevation of less than 8,000 feet above sea level
and at an ambient temperature of greater than or equal to 20 degrees
Fahrenheit;</li>
<li>TExcept as provided in section (d)(4.3.2)(B)(iv) below, cumulative
vehicle operation at or above 25 miles per hour occurs for greater than
or equal to 300 seconds while at an elevation of less than 8,000 feet
above sea level and at an ambient temperature of greater than or
equal to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (medium-duty vehicles with diesel
engines certified on an engine dynamometer may use cumulative
operation at or above 1150 rpm in lieu of at or above 25 miles per hour
for purposes of this criteria);</li>
<li>TContinuous vehicle operation at idle (i.e., accelerator pedal released
by driver and either vehicle speed less than or equal to one mile per
hour or engine speed less than or equal to 200 rpm above normal
warmed-up idle (as determined in the drive position for vehicles
equipped with an automatic transmission)) for greater than or equal to
30 seconds while at an elevation of less than 8,000 feet above sea
level and at an ambient temperature of greater than or equal to 20
degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>For 2004 through 2012 model year medium-duty vehicles with diesel
engines certified on an engine dynamometer, manufacturers may use
diesel engine operation at or above 15 percent calculated load in lieu
of 1150 rpm for the criterion in section (d)(4.3.2)(B)(ii) above.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In addition to the requirements of section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above, the
secondary air system monitor denominator(s) shall be incremented if and
only if commanded “on” operation of the secondary air system occurs for
a time greater than or equal to ten seconds. For purposes of determining
this commanded “on” time, the OBD II system may not include time during
intrusive operation of the secondary air system solely for the purposes of
monitoring;</li>
<li>Except as provided for in sections (d)(4.3.2)(D)(iv) and (d)(4.3.2)(L), the
evaporative system monitor denominator(s) shall be incremented if and
only if:
<ol type=i>

<li>Cumulative time since engine start is greater than or equal to 600
seconds while at an ambient temperature of greater than or equal to
40 degrees Fahrenheit but less than or equal to 95 degrees
Fahrenheit; and</li>
<li>Engine cold start occurs with engine coolant temperature at engine
start greater than or equal to 40 degrees Fahrenheit but less than or
equal to 95 degrees Fahrenheit and less than or equal to 12 degrees
Fahrenheit higher than ambient temperature at engine start.</li>
<li>For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, manufacturers may choose to
increment the evaporative system denominator(s) using the criteria

(d)(4.3.2)(D)(i) through (iii) above.</li>
</ol>
</li>

under “other emission control or source devices” (sections (e)(16) and
(f)(16)) or comprehensive component output components (section s
(e)(15) and (f)(15))
For purposes of determining this commanded “on” time, the OBD II
system may not include time during intrusive operation of any of the
components or strategies later in the same driving cycle solely for the
purposes of monitoring.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In addition to the requirements of section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above, the
denominator(s) for the following monitors of components (except those
operated only at engine start-up and subject to the requirements of the
previous section (d)(4.3.2)(E)) shall be incremented if and only if the
component is commanded to function (e.g., commanded “on”, “open”,

runners, torque converter clutch lock-up solenoids, etc.)</li>
<li>PM sensor heater (section (f)(5.2.4)(A))</li>
<li>PM filter active/intrusive injection (section (f)(9.2.6))

above.
For the PM filter active/intrusive injection monitor, as an alternative for
2013 through 2015 model year vehicles, the manufacturer may use the
criteria in section (d)(4.3.2)(I) in lieu of the criteria specified in section
(d)(4.3.2)(F) above.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For the following monitors, the denominator(s) shall be incremented by
one during a driving cycle in which the following two criteria are met: (1)
the requirements of section (d)(4.3.2)(B) have been met on at least one

</ol>
</li>
<li>For monitors of the following components, the manufacturer may request
Executive Officer approval to use alternate or additional criteria to that set
forth in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above for increm enting the denominator.
Executive Officer approval of the proposed criteria shall be based on the
equivalence of the proposed criteria in measuring the frequency of

<li>Air conditioning system input components (section (e)(12))</li>
<li>Direct ozone reduction systems (section (e)(14))</li>

monitoring evaluation (sections (e)(15) and (f)(15)) (e.g., stuck fuel
level sensor rationality)</li>

rationality monitors (sections (e)(15) and (f)(15)) (e.g, intake air
temperature sensor, ambient temperature sensor, fuel temperature
sensor)</li>

requirements of section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above, the denominator(s) for the
following monitors shall be incremented if and only if a regeneration event
is commanded for a time greater than or equa l to ten seconds:

functions (sections (f)(1.2.3)(A) and (f)(1.2.3)(C))</li>
<li>PM filter incomplete regeneration (section (f)(9.2.3))</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For vehicles that employ alternate engine start hardware or strategies
(e.g., integrated starter and generators) or alternate fuel vehicles (e.g.,
dedicated, bi-fuel, or dual-fuel applications), the manufacturer may
request Executive Officer approval to use alternate criteria to that set forth
in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above for incrementing the denominator. In
general, the Executive Officer shall not approve alternate criteria for
vehicles that only employ engine shut off at or near idle/vehicle stop
conditions. Executive Officer approval of the alternate criteria shall be
based on the equivalence of the alternate criteria to determine the amount
of vehicle operation relative to the measure of conventional vehicle
operation in accordance with the criteria in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above.</li>
<li>For 2014 and subsequent model year hybrid vehicles, in lieu of the criteria

diesel engines certified on an engine dynamometer may use
cumulative operation at or above 1150 rpm in lieu of at or above 25
miles per hour for purposes of this criteria);</li>
<li>Continuous vehicle operation at idle (i.e., accelerator pedal released
by driver and either vehicle speed less than or equal to one mile per
hour or engine speed less than or equal to 200 rpm above normal
warmed-up idle (as determined in the drive position for vehicles
equipped with an automatic transmission)) for greater than or equal to
30 seconds while at an elevation of less than 8,000 feet above sea
level and at an ambient temperature of greater than or equal to 20
degrees Fahrenheit; and</li>
<li>Cumulative fueled engine operation for greater than or equal to 10

</li>
<li>For 2015 and subsequent model year plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, in
addition to the requirements of sections (d)(4.3.2)(K)(i) through (iii) above,
