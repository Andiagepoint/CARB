(4.3.1) Definition: The denominator is defined as a measure of the number of times
a vehicle has been operated as defined in (d)(4.3.2).
(4.3.2)  Specifications for incrementing:
12
(A)   The denominator, when incremented, shall be incremented by an integer of
one. The denominator may not be incremented more than once per driving
cycle.
(B)   The denominator for each monitor shall be incremented within ten seconds if
and only if the following criteria are satisfied on a single driving cycle:
(i)   Cumulative time since engine start isgreater than or equal to 600
seconds while at an elevation of less than 8,000 feet above sea level and
at an ambient temperature of greater than or equal to 20 degrees
Fahrenheit;
(ii)   Cumulative vehicle operation at or above 25 miles per hour occurs for
greater than or equal to 300 seconds while at an elevation of less than
8,000 feet above sea level and at an ambient temperature of greater than
or equal to 20 degrees Fahrenheit;
(iii)  Continuous vehicle operation at idle (i.e., accelerator pedal released by
driver and vehicle speed less than or equal to one mile per hour) for
greater than or equal to 30 seconds while at an elevation of less than
8,000 feet above sea level and at an ambient temperature of greater than
or equal to 20 degrees Fahrenheit;
(C)  In addition to the requirements of section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above, the secondary
air system monitor denominator(s) shall be incremented if and only if
commanded “on” operation of the secondary air system occursfor a time
greater than or equal to ten seconds. For purposes of determining this
commanded “on” time, the OBDII system may not include time during
intrusive operation of the secondary air system solely for the purposes of
monitoring;
(D)  In addition to the requirements of section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above, the
evaporative system monitor denominator(s) shall be incremented if and only
if:
(i)   Cumulative time since engine start isgreater than or equal to 600
seconds while at an ambient temperature of greater than or equal to 40
degrees Fahrenheit but less than or equal to 95 degrees Fahrenheit;
(ii)   Engine cold start occurs with engine coolant temperature at engine start
greater than or equal to 40 degrees Fahrenheit but less than or equal to
95 degrees Fahrenheit and less than or equal to 12 degrees Fahrenheit
higher than ambient temperature at engine start.
(E)  In addition to the requirements of section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above, the
denominator(s) for the following monitors shall be incremented if and only if
the component or strategy is commanded “on” for a time greater than or
equal to ten seconds:
(i)   Heated catalyst (section (e)(2))
(ii)   Cold Start Emission Reduction Strategy (section (e)(11))
(iii)  Components or systems that operate only at engine start-up (e.g., glow
plugs, intake air heaters, etc.) and are subject to monitoring under “other
emission control or source devices” (section (e)(17)) or comprehensive
component output components (section (e)(16))
For purposes of determining this commanded “on” time, the OBDII system
13
may not include time during intrusive operation of any of the components or
strategies later in the same driving cycle solely for the purposes of
monitoring.
(F)  In addition to the requirements of section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above, the
denominator(s) for the following monitors of output components (except
those operated only at engine start-up and subject to the requirements of the
previous section (d)(4.3.2)(E)) shall be incremented if and only if the
component is commanded to function (e.g., commanded “on”, “open”,
“closed”, “locked”, etc.) on two or more occasions during the driving cycle or
for a time greater than or equal to ten seconds, whichever occurs first:
(i)   Air conditioning system (section (e)(12))
(ii)   Variable valve timing and/or control system (section (e)(13))
(iii)   “Other emission control or source device” (section (e)(17))
(iv)  Comprehensive component output component (section (e)(16)) (e.g.,
turbocharger waste-gates, variable length manifold runners, torque
converter clutch lock-up solenoids, etc.)
(G)  For monitors of the following components, the manufacturer may request
Executive Officer approval to use alternate or additional criteria to that set
forth in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above for incrementing the denominator.
Executive Officer approval of the proposed criteria shall be based on the
equivalence of the proposed criteria in measuring the frequency of monitor
operation relative to the amount of vehicle operation in accordance with the
criteria in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above:
(i)   Engine cooling system input components (section (e)(10))
(ii)   Air conditioning system input components (section (e)(12))
(iii)   Direct ozone reduction systems (section (e)(14))
(iv)  Particulate matter traps (section (e)(15))
(v)  “Other emission control or source devices” (section (e)(17))
(vi)  Comprehensive component input components that require extended
monitoring evaluation (section (e)(16)) (e.g., stuck fuel level sensor
rationality)
(H)  For hybrid vehicles, vehicles that employ alternate engine start hardware or
strategies (e.g., integrated starter and generators), or alternate fuel vehicles
(e.g., dedicated, bi-fuel, or dual-fuel applications), the manufacturer may
request Executive Officer approval to use alternate criteria to that set forth in
section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above for incrementing the denominator. In general, the
Executive Officer shall not approve alternate criteria for vehicles that only
employ engine shut off at or near idle/vehicle stop conditions. Executive
Officer approval of the alternate criteria shall be based on the equivalence of
the alternate criteria to determine the amount of vehicle operation relative to
the measure of conventional vehicle operation in accordance with the criteria
in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above.
