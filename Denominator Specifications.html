<li>TExcept as provided in section (d)(4.3.2)(B)(iv) below, cumulative
vehicle operation at or above 25 miles per hour occurs for greater than
or equal to 300 seconds while at an elevation of less than 8,000 feet
above sea level and at an ambient temperature of greater than or

only if commanded “on” operation of the secondary air system occurs for
a time greater than or equal to ten seconds. For purposes of determining
this commanded “on” time, the OBD II system may not include time during
intrusive operation of the secondary air system solely for the purposes of
monitoring;</li>
<li>Except as provided for in sections (d)(4.3.2)(D)(iv) and (d)(4.3.2)(L), the

</ol>
</li>

under “other emission control or source devices” (sections (e)(16) and
(f)(16)) or comprehensive component output components (section s
(e)(15) and (f)(15))
For purposes of determining this commanded “on” time, the OBD II
system may not include time during intrusive operation of any of the
components or strategies later in the same driving cycle solely for the
purposes of monitoring.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In addition to the requirements of section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above, the
denominator(s) for the following monitors of components (except those
operated only at engine start-up and subject to the requirements of the
previous section (d)(4.3.2)(E)) shall be incremented if and only if the
component is commanded to function (e.g., commanded “on”, “open”,
“closed”, “locked”, etc.) on two or more occasions for greater than two
seconds during the driving cycle or for a cumulative time greater than or
equal to ten seconds, whichever occurs first:
<ol type=i>
<li>Air conditioning system (section (e)(12))</li>
<li>Variable valve timing and/or control system (sections (e)(13) and
(f)(13))</li>
<li>“Other emission control or source device” (sections (e)(16) and (f)(16))</li>
<li>Comprehensive component output component (sections (e)(15) and
(f)(15)) (e.g., turbocharger waste-gates, variable length manifold
runners, torque converter clutch lock-up solenoids, etc.)</li>
<li>PM sensor heater (section (f)(5.2.4)(A))</li>
<li>PM filter active/intrusive injection (section (f)(9.2.6))
For the PM sensor heater monitor, as an alternative for 2013 through
2015 model year vehicles, the manufacturer may use the criteria in
section (d)(4.3.2)(B) in lieu of the criteria specified in section (d)(4.3.2)(F)
above.
For the PM filter active/intrusive injection monitor, as an alternative for
2013 through 2015 model year vehicles, the manufacturer may use the
criteria in section (d)(4.3.2)(I) in lieu of the criteria specified in section
(d)(4.3.2)(F) above.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For the following monitors, the denominator(s) shall be incremented by
one during a driving cycle in which the following two criteria are met: (1)
the requirements of section (d)(4.3.2)(B) have been met on at least one
driving cycle since the denominator was last incremented, and (2) the
number of cumulative miles of vehicle operation since the denominator
was last incremented is greater than or equal to 500 miles:
<ol type=i>
<li>Diesel NMHC converting catalyst (section (f)(1.2.2))</li>
<li>Diesel NMHC converting catalyst other aftertreatment assistance
functions (sections (f)(1.2.3)(B) and (f)(1.2.3)(D))</li>
<li>Diesel PM filter NMHC conversion (section (f)(9.2.4))</li>
<li>Diesel PM filter filtering performance and missing substrate (sections
(f)(9.2.1) and (f)(9.2.5)) for passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and
MDPVs certified to a chassis dynamometer tailpipe emission standard

(f)(9.2.1) and (f)(9.2.5)) for 2004 through 2015 model year medium duty vehicles certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe emission
standard</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For monitors of the following components, the manufacturer may request
Executive Officer approval to use alternate or additional criteria to that set
forth in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above for increm enting the denominator.
Executive Officer approval of the proposed criteria shall be based on the
equivalence of the proposed criteria in measuring the frequency of
monitor operation relative to the amount of vehicle operation in
accordance with the criteria in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above:
<ol type=i>
<li>Engine cooling system input components (sections (e)(10) and (f)(11))</li>
<li>Air conditioning system input components (section (e)(12))</li>
<li>Direct ozone reduction systems (section (e)(14))</li>
<li>“Other emission control or source devices” (sections (e)(16) and
(f)(16))</li>
<li>Comprehensive component input components that require extended
monitoring evaluation (sections (e)(15) and (f)(15)) (e.g., stuck fuel
level sensor rationality)</li>
<li>Comprehensive component input component temperature sensor
rationality monitors (sections (e)(15) and (f)(15)) (e.g, intake air
temperature sensor, ambient temperature sensor, fuel temperature
sensor)</li>
<li>PM filter frequent regeneration (section (f)(9.2.2))</li>
<li>PM sensor monitoring capablity monitor (section (f)(5.2.2)(D))</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles, in addition to the
requirements of section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above, the denominator(s) for the
following monitors shall be incremented if and only if a regeneration event
is commanded for a time greater than or equa l to ten seconds:
<ol type=i>
<li>Diesel NMHC converting catalyst other aftertreatment assistance
functions (sections (f)(1.2.3)(A) and (f)(1.2.3)(C))</li>
<li>PM filter incomplete regeneration (section (f)(9.2.3))</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For vehicles that employ alternate engine start hardware or strategies
(e.g., integrated starter and generators) or alternate fuel vehicles (e.g.,
dedicated, bi-fuel, or dual-fuel applications), the manufacturer may
request Executive Officer approval to use alternate criteria to that set forth
in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above for incrementing the denominator. In
general, the Executive Officer shall not approve alternate criteria for
vehicles that only employ engine shut off at or near idle/vehicle stop
conditions. Executive Officer approval of the alternate criteria shall be
based on the equivalence of the alternate criteria to determine the amount
of vehicle operation relative to the measure of conventional vehicle
operation in accordance with the criteria in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above.</li>
<li>For 2014 and subsequent model year hybrid vehicles, in lieu of the criteria
in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above, the denominator for each monitor shall be
incremented within ten seconds if and only if the following criteria are
satisfied on a single driving cycle:
<ol type=i>
<li>Cumulative propulsion system active time is greater than or equal to

level and at an ambient temperature of greater than or equal to 20

greater than or equal to 300 seconds while at an elevation of less than
8,000 feet above sea level and at an ambient temperature of greater
than or equal to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (medium -duty vehicles with
diesel engines certified on an engine dynamometer may use
cumulative operation at or above 1150 rpm in lieu of at or above 25
miles per hour for purposes of this criteria);</li>
<li>Continuous vehicle operation at idle (i.e., accelerator pedal released
