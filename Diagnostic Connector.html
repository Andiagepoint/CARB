A standard data link connector conforming to SAE J1962 specifications (except
as specified in section (g)(2.3)) shall be incorporated in each vehicle.
<dl>
<dt>2.1</dt>
<dd>The connector shall be located in the driver’s side foot-well region of the
vehicle interior in the area bound by the driver’s side of the vehicle and the
driver's side edge of the center console (or the vehicle centerline if the vehicle
does not have a center console) and at a location no higher than the bottom
of the steering wheel when in the lowest adjustable position. The connector
may not be located on or in the center console (i.e., neither on the horizontal
faces near the floor-mounted gear selector, parking brake lever, or cupholders nor on the vertical faces near the car stereo, climate system, or
navigation system controls). The location of the connector shall be capable
of being easily identified by a “crouched” technician entering the vehicle from
the driver’s side.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.2</dt>
<dd>If the connector is covered, the cover must be removable by hand without the
use of any tools and be labeled to aid technicians in identifying the location of
the connector. Access to the diagnostic connector may not require opening
or the removal of any storage accessory (e.g., ashtray, coinbox, etc.). The
label shall be submitted to the Executive Officer for review and approval, at or
before the time the manufacturer submits its certification application. The
Executive Officer shall approve the label upon determining that it clearly
identifies that the connector is located behind the cover and is consistent with
language and/or symbols commonly used in the automotive industry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.3</dt>
<dd>Any pins in the connector that provide electrical power shall be properly fused
to protect the integrity and usefulness of the connector for diagnostic
purposes and may not exceed 20.0 Volts DC regardless of the nominal
vehicle system or battery voltage (e.g., 12V, 24V, 42V, etc.).</dd>
