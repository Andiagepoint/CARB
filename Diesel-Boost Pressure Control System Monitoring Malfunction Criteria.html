<dd>Underboost:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the boost pressure
control system at or prior to a decrease from the manufacturer's
commanded or expected boost pressure that would cause a vehicle’s
NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM emissions to exceed:
(i) For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 2.0 times the applicable FTP standards for 2010 through 2012
model year vehicles; and
b. 1.5 times the applicable FTP NMHC, CO, or NOx standards or 2.0
times the applicable FTP PM standard for 2013 and subsequent
model year vehicles.
(ii) For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 2.5 times the applicable NMHC or CO standards, the applicable
NOx standard by more than 0.3 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause NOx
emissions to exceed 0.5 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission standard
is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle emission
test, or 0.03 g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test for 2010 through 2012 model year vehicles; and
b. 2.0 times the applicable NMHC or CO standards, the applicable
NOx standard by more than 0.2 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause NOx
emissions to exceed 0.4 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission standard
is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle emission
test, or 0.03 g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test for 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles.</li>
<li>For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of the boost pressure
control system that causes a decrease in boost could result in a vehicle’s
emissions exceeding the malfunction criteria specified in section
(f)(7.2.1)(A), the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction when either the
boost system has reached its control limits such that it cannot increase
boost to achieve the commanded boost pressure or, for non-feedback
controlled boost systems, the boost system has no detectable amount of
boost when boost is expected.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>7.2.2</dt>
<dd>Overboost:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the boost pressure
control system at or prior to an increase from the manufacturer's
commanded or expected boost pressure that would cause a vehicle's
NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM emissions to exceed the applicable emission
levels specified in sections (f)(7.2.1)(A).</li>
<li>For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of the boost pressure
control system that causes an increase in boost could result in a vehicle’s
emissions exceeding the malfunction criteria specified in section
(f)(7.2.2)(A), the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction when either the
boost system has reached its control limits such that it cannot decrease
boost to achieve the commanded boost pressure or, for non-feedback
controlled boost systems, the boost system has maximum detectable
boost when little or no boost is expected.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>7.2.3</dt>
<dd>Slow response:
<ol type=A>
<li>For 2010 through 2012 model year vehicles equipped with variable
geometry turbochargers (VGT), the OBD II system shall detect a
malfunction at or prior to any failure or deterioration in the capability of the
VGT system to achieve the commanded turbocharger geometry within a
manufacturer-specified time that would cause a vehicle's NMHC, CO,
NOx, or PM emissions to exceed the applicable emission levels specified
in section (f)(7.2.1)(A).  For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of
the VGT system response could result in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding
these levels, the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the VGT
system when no detectable response to a change in commanded
turbocharger geometry occurs.</li>
<li>For 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles, the OBD II system shall
detect a malfunction prior to any failure or deterioration in the boost
pressure control system response (e.g., capability to achieve the
commanded or expected boost pressure within a manufacturer-specified
time) that would cause vehicle's NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM emissions to
exceed the applicable emission levels specified in section (f)(7.2.1)(A).
For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of the boost system
response could result in an engine’s emissions exceeding these levels,
the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the boost system when no
detectable response to a commanded or expected change in boost
pressure occurs.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>7.2.4</dt>
<dd> Charge Air Undercooling:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the charge air cooling
system at or prior to a decrease from the manufacturer's specified cooling
rate that would cause a vehicle’s NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM emissions to
exceed the applicable emission levels specified in sections (f)(7.2.1)(A).</li>
<li>For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of the charge air cooling
system that causes a decrease in cooling performance could result in a
vehicle’s emissions exceeding the malfunction criteria specified in section
(f)(7.2.4)(A), the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction when the
system has no detectable amount of charge air cooling.</li>
<li>For purposes of determining the charge air cooling performance
malfunction criteria in section (f)(7.2.4)(A) for charge air cooling systems
that consist of more than one cooler (e.g., a pre -cooler and a main cooler,
two or more coolers in series), the manufacturer shall submit a charge air
cooling system aging and monitoring plan to the Executive Officer for
review and approval. The plan shall include the description and location
of each component, the monitoring strategy for each component and
combination of components, and the method for determining the
malfunction criteria of section (f)(7.2.4)(A) including the deterioration/aging
process. Executive Officer approval of the plan shall be based on the
representativeness of the aging to real world charge air cooling system
component deterioration under normal and malfunctioning engine
operating conditions and the effectiveness of the method used to
determine the malfunction criteria of section (f)(7.2.4)(A).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>7.2.5</dt>
<dd>Feedback control:
<ol type=A>
<li>Except as provided for in section (f)(7.2.5)(B), if the vehicle is equipped
with feedback or feed-forward control of the boost pressure system (e.g.,
control of VGT position, turbine speed, manifold pressure) the OBD II
system shall detect a malfunction:
(i) If the system fails to begin control within a manufacturer specified time
interval;
(ii) If a failure or deterioration causes open loop or default operation; or
(iii) If the control system has used up all of the adjustment allowed by the
manufacturer or reached its maximum authority and cannot achieve
the target.</li>
<li>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to temporarily
disable monitoring for the malfunction criteria specified in section
(f)(7.2.5)(A)(iii) during conditions that a manufacturer cannot robustly
distinguish between a malfunctioning system and a properly operating
system. The Executive Officer shall approve the disablement upon the
manufacturer submitting data and/or analysis demonstrating that the
control system, when operating as designed on a vehicle with all emission
controls working properly, routinely operates during these conditions with
all of the adjustment allowed by the manufacturer used up.</li>
<li>In lieu of detecting the malfunctions specified in sections ( f)(7.2.5)(A)(i)
and (ii) with a boost pressure system-specific monitor, the OBD II system
may monitor the individual parameters or components that are used as
inputs for boost pressure system feedback control provided that the
monitors detect all malfunctions that meet the criteria in sections
(f)(7.2.5)(A)(i) and (ii).</li>
