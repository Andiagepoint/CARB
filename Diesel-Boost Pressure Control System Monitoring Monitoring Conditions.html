 <dt>7.3.1</dt>
 <dd>Except as provided in section (f)(7.3.4), the OBD II system shall monitor
 continuously for malfunctions identified in sections (f)(7.2.1), (7.2.2), and
 (7.2.5) (i.e., over and under boost, feedback control).</dd>
 <dt>7.3.2</dt>
 <dd>Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
 identified in section (f)(7.2.3) (i.e., slow response) in accordance with
 sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements), with the
 exception that monitoring shall occur every time the monitoring conditions
 are met during the driving cycle in lieu of once per driving cycle as
 required in section (d)(3.1.2). For all 2010 and subsequent model year
 vehicles, for purposes of tracking and reporting as required in section
 (d)(3.2.2), all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in section
 (f)(7.2.3) shall be tracked separately but reported as a single set of values
 as specified in section (d)(5.2.2).</dd>
 <dt>7.3.3</dt>
 <dd>Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
 identified in section (f)(7.2.4) (i.e., charge air cooler performance) in
 accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio
 requirements). For purposes of tracking and reporting as required in
 section (d)(3.2.2), all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in
 section (f)(7.2.4) shall be tracked separately but reported as a single set
 of values as specified in section (d)(5.2.2).</dd>
 <dt>7.3.4</dt>
 <dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to temporarily
 disable continuous monitoring under conditions technically necessary to
 ensure robust detection of malfunctions and to avoid false passes and
 false indications of malfunctions (e.g., disable monitoring of underboost
 when commanded or expected boost pressure is very low).  The
 Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the
 manufacturer has submitted data and/or an engineering evaluation which
 demonstrate that a properly operating system cannot be distinguished
 from a malfunctioning system and that the disablement interval is limited
 only to that technically necessary.</dd>
