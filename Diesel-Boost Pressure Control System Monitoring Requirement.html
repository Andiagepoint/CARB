<dt>7.1.1</dt>
<dd> For 2010 and subsequent model year vehicles, the OBD II system shall
monitor the boost pressure control system (e.g., turbocharger) on vehicles
so-equipped for under and over boost malfunctions and slow response
malfunctions. For vehicles equipped with charge air cooler systems, the
OBD II system shall monitor the charge air cooler system for cooling
system performance malfunctions.  For 2004 and subsequent model year
vehicles, the individual electronic components (e.g., actuators, valves,
sensors) that are used in the boost pressure control system shall be
monitored in accordance with the comprehensive component
requirements in section (f)(15).</dd>
<dt>7.1.2</dt>
<dd>For vehicles with other charge control strategies that affect boost pressure
(e.g., systems that modify boost pressure to achieve a desired air-fuel
ratio instead of a desired boost pressure), the manufacturer shall submit a
monitoring plan to the Executive Officer for approval. The Executive
Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer
has submitted data and an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that
the monitoring plan is as reliable and ef fective as the monitoring plan
required for boost pressure control systems under section (f)(7).</dd>
