<dt>12.2.1</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall, to the extent feasible, detect a
malfunction if either of the following occurs:
(12.2.1) Any single commanded element/component does not properly respond
to the commanded action while the cold start strategy is active. For
purposes of this section, “properly respond” is defined as when the
element responds:
<ol type=A>
<li>by a robustly detectable amount by the monitor; and</li>
<li>in the direction of the desired command; and</li>
<li>above and beyond what the element/component would achieve on startup without the cold start strategy active (e.g., if the cold start strategy
commands a higher idle engine speed, a fault must be detected if there is
no detectable amount of engine speed increase above what the system
would achieve without the cold start strategy active);</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>12.2.2</dt>
<dd>Any failure or deterioration of the cold start emission reduction control
strategy that would cause a vehicle’s NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM emissions
to exceed:
<ol type=A>
<li>For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
<ol type=i>
<li>2.5 times the applicable FTP standards for 2010 through 2012 model
year vehicles; and</li>
<li>1.5 times the applicable FTP NMHC, CO, or NOx standards or 2.0
times the applicable FTP PM standard for 2013 and subsequent model
year vehicles.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
(i) 2.0 times the applicable NMHC or CO standards, the applicable NOx
standard by more than 0.2 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause NOx emissions to
exceed 0.4 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr)
as measured from an applicable cycle emission test, or 0.03 g/bhp-hr
PM as measured from an applicable cycle emission test for 2013 and
subsequent model year vehicles.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>12.2.3</dt>
<dd>For section (f)(12.2.2):
<ol type=A>
<li>For 2010 through 2012 model year vehicles, the OBD II system shall
either monitor the combined effect of the elements o f the system as a
whole or the individual elements (e.g., increased engine speed, increased
engine load from restricting an exhaust throttle) for failures that cause
emissions to exceed the applicable emission levels specified in section
(f)(12.2.2).</li>
<li>CFor 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles, to the extent feasible
(without adding hardware for this purpose), the OBD II system shall
monitor the ability of the system to achieve the desired effect (e.g.,
strategies used to accelerate catalyst light-off by increasing catalyst inlet
temperature shall verify the catalyst inlet temperature actually achieves
the desired temperatures within an Executive Officer approved time
interval after starting the engine) for failures that cause emissions to
exceed the applicable emission levels specified in section (f)(12.2.2). For
strategies where it is not feasible to be monitored as a system, the OBD II
system shall monitor the individual elements/components (e.g., increased
engine speed, increased engine load from restricting an exhaust throttle)
for failures that cause emissions to exceed the applicable emission levels
specified in section (f)(12.2.2).</li>
