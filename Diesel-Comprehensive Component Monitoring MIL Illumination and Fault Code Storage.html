<dd>Except as provided in sections (f)(15.4.2) and (f)(15.4.4) below, general
requirements for MIL illumination and fault code storage are set forth in
section (d)(2).</dd>
<dt>15.4.2</dt>
<dd> Exceptions to general requirements for MIL illumination. MIL illumination
is not required in conjunction with storing a confirmed fault code for any
comprehensive component if:
<ol type=A>
<li>the component or system, when malfunctioning, could not cause vehicle
emissions to increase by:
(i) 25 percent or more for PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles, or
(ii) 15 percent or more for all other vehicles, and</li>
<li>the component or system is not used as part of the diagnostic strategy for
any other monitored system or component.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>15.4.3</dt>
<dd>For purposes of determining the emission increase in section
(f)(15.4.2)(A), the manufacturer shall request Executive Officer approval of
the test cycle/vehicle operating conditions for which the emission increase
will be determined. Executive Officer approval shall be granted upon
determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or engineering
evaluation that demonstrate that the testing conditions represent in-use
driving conditions where emissions are likely to be most affected by the
malfunctioning component. For purposes of determining whether the
specified percentages in section (f)(15.4.2)(A) are exceeded, if the
approved testing conditions are comprised of an emission test cycle with
an exhaust emission standard, the measured increase shall be compared
to a percentage of the exhaust emission standard (e.g., if the increase is
equal to or more than 15 percent of the exhaust emission standard for
that test cycle). If the approved testing conditions are comprised of a test
cycle or vehicle operating condition that does not have an exhaust
emission standard, the measured increase shall be calculated as a
percentage of the baseline test (e.g., if the increase from a back-to-back
test sequence between normal and malfunctioning condition is equal to or
more than 15 percent of the baseline test results from the normal
condition).</dd>
<dt>15.4.4</dt>
<dd>For malfunctions required to be detected by section (f)(15.2.2)(B)(iii) (idle
control fuel injection quantity faults), the stored fault code is not required
to specifically identify the idle control system (e.g., a  fault code for cylinder
fuel injection quantity imbalance or combustion quality monitoring can be
stored).</dd>
