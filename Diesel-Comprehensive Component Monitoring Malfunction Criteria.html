 <dd>Input Components:
 (A) The OBD II system shall detect malfunctions of input components caused
 by a lack of circuit continuity, out-of-range values, and, where feasible,
 rationality faults. To the extent feasible, the rationality fault diagnostics
 shall verify that a sensor output is neither inappropriately high nor
 inappropriately low (e.g., “two-sided” diagnostics).
 (B) To the extent feasible, rationality faults shall be separately detected and
 store different fault codes than the respective lack of circuit continuity and
 out of range diagnostics. Additionally, input component lack of circuit
 continuity and out of range faults shall be separately detected and store
 different fault codes for each distinct malfunction (e.g., out-of-range low,
 out-of-range high, open circuit, etc.). Manufacturers are not required to
 store separate fault codes for lack of circuit continuity faults that cannot be
 distinguished from other out-of-range circuit faults.
 (C) For input components that are directly or indirectly used for any emission
 control strategies that are not covered under sections (f)(1) through (f)(13)
 (e.g., exhaust temperature sensors used for a control strategy that
 regulates SCR catalyst inlet temperature within a target window), the
 OBD II system shall detect rationality malfunctions that prevent the
 component from correctly sensing any condition necessary for the
 strategy to operate in its intended manner. These malfunctions include
 faults that inappropriately prevent or delay the activation of the emission
 control strategy, cause the system to erroneously exit the emission control
 strategy, or where the control strategy has used up all of the adjustments
 or authority allowed by the manufacturer and is still unable to achieve the
 desired condition. The Executive Officer may waive detection of specific
 malfunctions upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data
 and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that reliable detection
 of the malfunction is technically infeasible or would require additional
 hardware.</dd>

 <dd>Output Components/Systems:
 <ol type=A>
 <li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of an output
 component/system when proper functional response of the component
 and system to computer commands does not occur. If a functional check
 is not feasible, the OBD II system shall detect malfunctions of output
 components/systems caused by a lack of circuit continuity or circuit fault
 (e.g., short to ground or high voltage). For output component lack of
 circuit continuity faults and circuit faults, manufacturers are not required to
 store different fault codes for each distinct malfunction (e.g., open circuit,
 shorted low, etc.). Manufacturers are not required to activate an output
 component/system when it would not normally be active for the purposes
 of performing functional monitoring of output components/systems as
 required in section (f)(15).</li>
 <li>The idle fuel control system shall be monitored for proper functional
 response to computer commands.  A malfunction shall be detected when
 any of the following conditions occur:
 <ol type=i>
 <li>The idle control system cannot achieve or maintain the idle speed
 within +/- 30 percent of the manufacturer-specified target or desired
 engine speed.</li>
 <li>The idle control system cannot achieve the target idle speed within the
 smallest engine speed tolerance range required by the OBD II system
 to enable any other monitor.</li>
 <li>For 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles, the idle control system
 cannot achieve the fuel injection quantity within the smallest fueling
 quantity tolerance range required by the OBD II system to enable any
 other monitor.</li>
 <li>For 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles, the idle control system
 cannot achieve the target idle speed with a fuel injection quantity within
 +/-50 percent of the fuel quantity necessary to achieve the target idle
 speed for a properly functioning vehicle and the given operating
 conditions.</li>
 </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Glow plugs/intake air heaters shall be monitored for proper functional
 response to computer commands. The glow plug/intake air heater
 circuit(s) shall be monitored for proper current and voltage drop.  The
 Executive Officer shall approve other monitoring strategies based on
 manufacturer’s data and/or engineering analysis demonstrating equally
 reliable and timely detection of malfunctions. If a manufacturer
 demonstrates that a single glow plug failure cannot cause a measurable
 increase in emissions during any reasonable driving condition, the
 manufacturer shall detect a malfunction for the minimum number of glow
 plugs needed to cause an emission increase. Further, to the extent
 feasible on existing engine designs (without adding additional hardware
 for this purpose) and on all new design engines, the stored fault code
 shall identify the specific malfunctioning glow plug(s).  For 2010 and
 subsequent model year vehicles, manufacturers shall detect a malfunction
 when a single glow plug/intake air heater no longer operates within the
 manufacturer’s specified limits for normal operation (e.g., within
 specifications established by the manufacturer with the part supplier for
 acceptable part performance at high mileage).</li>
 <li>The wait-to-start lamp circuit shall be monitored for malfunctions that
 cause the lamp to fail to illuminate when commanded on (e.g., burned out
 bulb).</li>
 <li>For output components/systems that are directly or indirectly used for any
 emission control strategies that are not covered under sections (f)(1)
 through (f)(13) (e.g., an intake throttle used for a control strategy that
 adjusts intake throttle position to regulate SCR catalyst inlet temperature
 within a target window), the OBD II system shall detect functional
 malfunctions that prevent the component/system from achieving the
 desired functional response necessary for the strategy to operate in its
 intended manner. These malfunctions include faults that inappropriately
 prevent or delay the activation of the emission control strategy, cause the
 system to erroneously exit the emission control strategy, or where the
 control strategy has used up all of the adjustments or authority allowed by
 the manufacturer and is still unable to achieve the desired con dition. The
 Executive Officer may waive detection of specific malfunctions upon
 determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or an
 engineering evaluation that demonstrate that reliable detection of the
 malfunction is technically infeasible or would require additional hardware.</li>
 <li>For 2015 and subsequent model year vehicles that utilize fuel control
 system components (e.g., injectors, fuel pump) that have tolerance
 compensation features implemented in hardware or software during
 production or repair procedures (e.g., individually coded injectors for flow
 characteristics that are programmed into an electronic control unit to
 compensate for injector to injector tolerances, fuel pumps that use in-line
 resistors to correct for differences in fuel pump volume output), the
 components shall be monitored to ensure the proper compensation is
 being used.
 <ol type=i>
 <li>The system shall detect a fault if the compensation being used by the
 control system does not match the compensation designated for the
 installed component (e.g., the flow characteristic coding designated on
 a specific injector does not match the compensation being used by the
 fuel control system for that injector). If a manufacturer demonstrates
 that a single component (e.g., injector) using the wrong compe nsation
 cannot cause a measurable increase in emissions during any
 reasonable driving condition, the manufacturer shall detect a
 malfunction for the minimum number of components using the wrong
 compensation needed to cause an emission increase. Further, the
 stored fault code shall identify the specific component that does not
 match the compensation.</li>
 <li>Monitoring of the fuel control system components under section
 (f)(15.2.2)(F)(i) is not required if the manufacturer demonstrates that
 both of the following criteria are satisfied: (1) no fault of the
 components’ tolerance compensation features (e.g., wrong
 compensation being used) could cause emissions to increase by 15
 percent or more of the applicable full useful life standard as measured
 from an applicable emission test cycle; and (2) no fault of the
 components’ tolerance compensation features could cause emissions
 to exceed the applicable full useful life standard as measured from an
 applicable emission test cycle.  For purposes of determining if the
 emission criteria above are met, the manufacturers shall request
 Executive Officer approval of the test plan for which the emission
 impact will be determined. The test plan shall include the combination
 of failed components and the degree of mismatch (e.g., wrong
 compensation) used as well as the test procedure and emission test
 cycles used to demonstrate the emission impact, including the
 necessary preconditioning cycles used by the system to correct or
 adapt for any mismatch and mitigate the emission impact. Executive
 Officer approval shall be granted upon determining that the
 manufacturer has submitted data and/or engineering analysis that
 demonstrate that the conditions necessary for the system to correct or
 adapt will readily occur in a timely manner during in-use operation and
 that the test conditions represent worst case emissions from typical in use service actions when considering the distribution and variance of
 the compensation values and parts (e.g., replacement of one or more
 plus-one-sigma injectors with minus-one-sigma injectors without
 updating of the compensation value).</li>
