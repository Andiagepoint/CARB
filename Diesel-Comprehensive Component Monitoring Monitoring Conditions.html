<dd>Input Components:
<ol type=A>
<li>Except as provided in section (f)(15.3.1)(C), input components shall be
monitored continuously for proper range of values and circuit continuity.</li>
<li>For rationality monitoring (where applicable), manufacturers shall define
the monitoring conditions for detecting malfunctions in accordance with
sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements), with the
exception that rationality monitoring shall occur every time the monitoring
conditions are met during the driving cycle in lieu of once per driving cycle
as required in section (d)(3.1.2).:</li>
<li>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable
continuous input component proper range of values or circuit continuity
monitoring when a malfunction cannot be distinguished from other effects.
The Executive Officer shall approve the disablement upon determining
that the manufacturer has submitted test data and/or documentation t hat
demonstrate a properly functioning input component cannot be
distinguished from a malfunctioning input component and that the
disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false
detection.</li>

<dd>Output Components/Systems:
<ol type=A>
<li>Except as provided in section (f)(15.3.2)(D), monitoring for circuit
continuity and circuit faults shall be conducted continuously.</li>
<li>Except as provided in section (f)(15.3.2)(C), for functional monitoring,
manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for detecting
malfunctions in accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e.,
minimum ratio requirements).</li>
<li>For the idle fuel control system, manufacturers shall define the monitoring
conditions for functional monitoring in accordance with sections (d)(3.1)
and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements), with the exception that
functional monitoring shall occur every time the monitoring conditions are
met during the driving cycle in lieu of once per driving cycle as required in
section (d)(3.1.2).</li>
<li>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable
continuous output component circuit continuity or circuit fault monitoring
when a malfunction cannot be distinguished from other effects. The
Executive Officer shall approve the disablement upon determining that the
manufacturer has submitted test data and/or documentation that
demonstrate a properly functioning output component cannot be
distinguished from a malfunctioning output component and that the
disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false
detection.</li>
