 <dt>15.1.1</dt>
 <dd>Except as provided in sections (f)(15.1.3), (f)(15.1.4), and (f)(16), the
 OBD II system shall monitor for malfunction any electronic powertrain
 component/system not otherwise described in sections (f)(1) through
 (f)(14) that either provides input to (directly or indirectly) or receives
 commands from the on-board computer(s), and: (1) can affect emissions
 during any reasonable in-use driving condition, or (2) is used as part of
 the diagnostic strategy for any other monitored system or component.
 <ol type=A>
 <li>Input Components: Input components required to be monitored may
 include the vehicle speed sensor, crank angle sensor,  pedal position
 sensor, mass air flow sensor, cam position sensor, fuel pressure sensor,
 intake air temperature sensor, exhaust temperature sensor,  and
 transmission electronic components such as sensors, modules, and
 solenoids which provide signals to the powertrain control system.</li>
 <li>Output Components/Systems: Output components/systems required to be
 monitored may include the idle governor, fuel injectors, automatic
 transmission solenoids or controls, turbocharger electronic components,
 the wait-to-start lamp, and cold start aids (e.g., glow plugs, intake air
 heaters).</li>
 </ol>
 </dd>
 <dt>15.1.2</dt>
 <dd>For purposes of criteria (1) in section (f)(15.1.1) above, the manufacturer
 shall determine whether a powertrain input or output component/system
 can affect emissions. If the Executive Officer reasonably believes that a
 manufacturer has incorrectly determined that a component/system cannot
 affect emissions, the Executive Officer shall require the manufacturer to
 provide emission data showing that the component/system, when
 malfunctioning and installed in a suitable test vehicle, does not have an
 emission effect.  The Executive Officer may request emission data for any
 reasonable driving condition.</dd>
 <dt>15.1.3</dt>
 <dd>Manufacturers shall monitor for malfunction electronic powertrain input or
 output components/systems associated with an electronic transfer case,
 electronic power steering system, two speed axle, or other components
 that are driven by the engine and not related t o the control of fueling, air
 handling, or emissions only if the component or system is used as part of
 the diagnostic strategy for any other monitored system or component.</dd>
 <dt>15.1.4</dt>
 <dd>Except as specified for hybrids in section (f)(15.1.5), manufacturers shall
 monitor for malfunction electronic powertrain input or output
 components/systems associated with components that only affect
 emissions by causing additional electrical load to the engine and are not
 related to the control of fueling, air handling, or emissions on ly if the
 109
 component or system is used as part of the diagnostic strategy for any
 other monitored system or component.</dd>
 <dt>15.1.5</dt>
 <dd>For hybrids, manufacturers shall submit a plan to the Executive Officer
 for approval of the hybrid components  determined by the manufacturer to
 be subject to monitoring in section (f)(15.1.1). In general, the Executive
 Officer shall approve the plan if it includes monitoring of all
 components/systems used as part of the diagnostic strategy for any other
 monitored system or component, monitoring of all energy input devices to
 the electrical propulsion system, monitoring of battery and charging
 system performance, monitoring of electric motor performance, and
 monitoring of regenerative braking performance.</dd>
