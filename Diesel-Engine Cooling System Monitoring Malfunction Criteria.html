<dd>Thermostat
(A) The OBD II system shall detect a thermostat malfunction  (e.g., leaking or
early-to-open thermostat) if, within an Executive Officer approved time
102
interval after starting the engine, either of the following two conditions
occur:
(i) The coolant temperature does not reach the highest temperature
required by the OBD II system to enable other diagnostics;
(ii) The coolant temperature does not reach a warmed-up temperature
within 20 degrees Fahrenheit of the manufacturer’s nominal thermostat
regulating temperature. Subject to Executive Officer approval, a
manufacturer may utilize lower temperatures for this criterion upon the
Executive Officer determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated
that the fuel, injection timing, and/or other coolant temperature-based
modifications to the engine control strategies would not cause an
emission increase of 50 or more percent of any of the applicable
standards.
(B) For 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles, the OBD II system shall
detect a thermostat fault if, after the coolant temperature has reached the
temperatures indicated in sections (f)(11.2.1)(A)(i) and (ii), the coolant
temperature drops below the temperature indicated in section
(f)(11.2.1)(A)(i).
(C) Executive Officer approval of the time interval after engine start under
section (f)(11.2.1)(A) above shall be granted upon determining that the
data and/or engineering evaluation submitted by the manufacturer
supports the specified times.
(D) For monitoring of malfunctions under section (f)(11.2.1)(A), with Executive
Officer approval, a manufacturer may use alternate malfunction criteria
and/or monitoring conditions (see section (f)(11.3)) that are a function of
temperature at engine start on vehicles that do not reach the
temperatures specified in the malfunction criteria when the thermostat is
functioning properly. Executive Officer approval shall be granted upon
determining that the manufacturer has submitted data that demonstrate
that a properly operating system does not reach the specified
temperatures, that the monitor is capable of meeting the specified
malfunction criteria at engine start temperatures greater than 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, and that the overall effectiveness of the monitor is
comparable to a monitor meeting these thermostat monitoring
requirements at lower temperatures.
(E) With Executive Officer approval, manufacturers may omit this monitor.
Executive Officer approval shall be granted upon determining that the
manufacturer has demonstrated that a malfunctioning thermostat cannot
cause a measurable increase in emissions during any reasonable driving
condition nor cause any disablement of other monitors.</dd>

<dd>ECT Sensor
(A) Circuit Continuity. The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction when  a
lack of circuit continuity or out-of-range value occurs.
(B) Time to Reach Closed-Loop Enable Temperature.
(i) The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor does
not achieve the stabilized minimum temperature which is needed to
begin closed-loop or feedback operation of emission-related engine
controls (e.g., feedback control of fuel pressure, EGR flow, boost
103
pressure) within an Executive Officer approved time interval after
starting the engine. The time interval shall be a function of starting
ECT and/or a function of intake or ambient temperature.
(ii) Executive Officer approval of the time interval shall be granted upon
determining that the data and/or engineering evaluation submitted by
the manufacturer supports the specified times.
(iii) The Executive Officer shall exempt manufacturers from the
requirement of section (f)(11.2.2)(B) if the manufacturer does not
utilize ECT to enable closed loop or feedback operation of emissionrelated engine controls.
(C) Stuck in Range Below the Highest Minimum Enable Temperature. To the
extent feasible when using all available information, the OBD II system
shall detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor inappropriately indicates a
temperature below the highest minimum enable temperature required by
the OBD II system to enable other diagnostics (e.g., an OBD II system
that requires ECT to be greater than 140 degrees Fahrenheit to enable a
diagnostic must detect malfunctions that cause the ECT sensor to
inappropriately indicate a temperature below 140 degrees Fahrenheit).
Manufacturers are exempted from this requirement for temperature
regions in which the monitors required under sections (f)(11.2.1) or
(f)(11.2.2)(B) will detect ECT sensor malfunctions as defined in section
(f)(11.2.2)(C).
(D) Stuck in Range Above the Lowest Maximum Enable Temperature.
(i) To the extent feasible when using all available information, the OBD II
system shall detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor inappropriately
indicates a temperature above the lowest maximum enable
temperature required by the OBD II system to enable other diagnostics
(e.g., an OBD II system that requires ECT to be less than 90 degrees
Fahrenheit at engine start to enable a diagnostic must detect
malfunctions that cause the ECT sensor to inappropriately indicate a
temperature above 90 degrees Fahrenheit).
(ii) Manufacturers are exempted from this requirement for temperature
regions in which the monitors required under sections (f)(11.2.1),
(f)(11.2.2)(B), or (f)(11.2.2)(C) (i.e., ECT sensor or thermostat
malfunctions) will detect ECT sensor malfunctions as defined in
section (f)(11.2.2)(D) or in which the MIL will be illuminated under the
requirements of section (d)(2.2.3) for default mode operation (e.g.,
overtemperature protection strategies).
(iii) For 2006 and subsequent model year applications, manufacturers are
also exempted from the requirements of section (f)(11.2.2)(D) for
temperature regions where the temperature gauge indicates a
temperature in the red zone (engine overheating zone) or an
overtemperature warning light is illuminated for vehicles that have a
temperature gauge or warning light on the instrument panel and utilize
the same ECT sensor for input to the OBD II system and the
temperature gauge/warning light.</dd>
