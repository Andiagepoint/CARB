<dd>Thermostat
104
(A) Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in section (f)(11.2.1)(A) in accordance with section (d)(3.1)
except as provided for in section (f)(11.3.1)(E). Additionally, except as
provided for in sections (f)(11.3.1)(B) and (C), monitoring for malfunctions
identified in section (f)(11.2.1)(A) shall be conducted once per driving
cycle on every driving cycle in which the ECT sensor indicates, at engine
start, a temperature lower than the temperature established as the
malfunction criteria in section (f)(11.2.1)(A).
(B) Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in section (f)(11.2.1)(B) in accordance with section (d)(3.1) with
the exception that monitoring shall occur every time the monitoring
conditions are met during the driving cycle in lieu of once per driving cycle.
(C) Manufacturers may disable thermostat monitoring at ambient
temperatures below 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
(D) Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to suspend or
disable thermostat monitoring if the vehicle is subjected to conditions
which could lead to false diagnosis (e.g., vehicle operation at idle for more
than 50 percent of the warm-up time, hot restart conditions, etc.). In
general, the Executive Officer shall not approve disablement of the
monitor on engine starts where the ECT at engine start is more than 35
degrees Fahrenheit lower than the thermostat malfunction threshold
temperature determined under section (f)(11.2.1)(A). The Executive
Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer
has provided data and/or engineering analysis that demonstrate the need
for the request.
(E) With respect to defining enable conditions that are encountered during
the FTP or Unified cycle as required in (d)(3.1.1) for malfunctions
identified in section (f)(11.2.1)(A), the FTP cycle shall refer to on-road
driving following the FTP cycle in lieu of testing on a chassis or engine
dynamometer.</dd>
<dt>11.3.2</dt>
<dd>ECT Sensor
(A) Except as provided below in section (f)(11.3.2)(E), monitoring for
malfunctions identified in section (f)(11.2.2)(A) (i.e., circuit continuity and
out-of-range) shall be conducted continuously.
(B) Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in section (f)(11.2.2)(B) in accordance with section (d)(3.1).
Additionally, except as provided for in section (f)(11.3.2)(D), monitoring for
malfunctions identified in section (f)(11.2.2)(B) shall be conducted once
per driving cycle on every driving cycle in which the ECT sensor indicates
a temperature lower than the closed-loop enable temperature at engine
start (i.e., all engine start temperatures greater than the ECT sensor outof-range low temperature and less than the closed-loop enable
temperature).
(C) Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in sections (f)(11.2.2)(C) and (D) in accordance with sections
(d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements).
(D) Manufacturers may suspend or delay the time to reach closed-loop
enable temperature diagnostic if the vehicle is subjected to conditions
105
which could lead to false diagnosis (e.g., vehicle operation at idle for more
than 50 to 75 percent of the warm-up time).
(E) A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable
continuous ECT sensor monitoring when an ECT sensor malfunction
cannot be distinguished from other effects. The Executive Officer shall
approve the disablement upon determining that the manufacturer has
submitted test data and/or engineering evaluation that demonstrate a
properly functioning sensor cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning
sensor and that the disablement interval is limited only to that necessary
for avoiding false detection.</dd>
