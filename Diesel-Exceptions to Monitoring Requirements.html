<dd>Except as provided in sections (f)(17.1.1) through (17.1.4) below, upon
request of a manufacturer or upon the best engineering judgment of the ARB,
the Executive Officer may revise the emission threshold for a malfunction on
any diagnostic required in section (f) for medium-duty vehicles if the most
reliable monitoring method developed requires a higher threshold to prevent
false indications of a malfunction.  Additionally, except as specified in section
(f)(9.2.1)(A)(iii), for 2007 through 2013 model year light-duty vehicles and
2007 through 2015 model year medium-duty vehicles, the Executive Officer
may revise the PM filter malfunction criteria of section (f)(9.2.1) to exclude
detection of specific failure modes (e.g., combined failure of partially melted
and partially cracked substrates) if the most reliable monitoring method
developed requires the exclusion of specific failure modes to prevent false
indications of a malfunction.
<dl>
<dt>17.1.1</dt>
<dd> For PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles, the Executive Officer shall approve a
malfunction criterion of 2.5 times the applicable FTP standards in lieu of
1.5 or 1.75 wherever required in section (f).</dd>
<dt>17.1.2</dt>
<dd>For vehicles certified to Federal Bin 3 or Bin 4 emission standards,
manufacturers shall utilize the ULEV II vehicle NMOG and CO malfunction
criteria (e.g., 1.5 times the Bin 3 or Bin 4 NMOG and CO standards) and
the PC/LDT SULEV II vehicle NOx malfunction criteria (e.g., 2.5 times the
Bin 3 or Bin 4 NOx standards).</dd>
<dt>17.1.3</dt>
<dd> For medium-duty diesel vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard, the Executive Officer shall
approve a malfunction criteria of “the applicable PM standard plus 0.02
g/bhp-hr PM (e.g., unable to maintain PM emissions at or below 0.03
g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission standard is 0.01 g/bhp-hr) as measured
from an applicable cycle emission test” in lieu of “0.03 g/bhp-hr PM as
measured from an applicable cycle emission test” wherever required in
section (f). The Executive Officer shall also approve a malfunction criteria
of “the applicable PM standard plus 0.04 g/bhp-hr PM (e.g., unable to
maintain PM emissions at or below 0.05 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission
standard is 0.01 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle emission
test” in lieu of “0.05 g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test” wherever required in section (f).</dd>
<dt>17.1.4</dt>
<dd>For 2007 through 2009 medium-duty diesel vehicles (including MDPVs)
certified to an engine dynamometer FTP tailpipe PM emission standard of
greater than or equal 0.08 g/bhp-hr, the Executive Officer shall approve a
malfunction of criteria of 1.5 times the applicable PM standard in lieu of
the applicable PM malfunction criteria required for any monitor in section
(f).</dd>
<dt>17.1.5.</dt>
<dd>For 2004 through 2015 model year medium-duty diesel vehicles (except
MDPVs) certified to a chassis dynamometer tailpipe emission standard,
the monitoring requirements and malfunction criteria in section (f)
applicable to medium-duty diesel vehicles certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard shall apply. However, the
manufacturer shall request Executive Officer approval of manufacturerproposed medium-duty chassis dynamometer-based malfunction criteria
in lieu of the engine dynamometer-based malfunction criteria required for
each monitor in section (f). The Executive Officer shall approve the
request upon finding that:
<ol type=A>
<li>the manufacturer has used good engineering judgment in determining the
malfunction criteria,</li>
<li>the malfunction criteria will provide for similar timeliness in detection of
malfunctioning components with respect to detection of malfunctions on
medium-duty diesel vehicles certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe
emission standard,</li>
<li>the malfunction criteria are set as stringently as technologically feasible
with respect to indicating a malfunction at the lowest possible tailpipe
emission levels (but not lower than 1.5 times the chassis dynamometer
tailpipe emission standard the vehicle is certified to), considering the best
available monitoring technology to the extent that it is known or should
have been known to the manufacturer,</li>
<li>the malfunction criteria will prevent detection of a malfunction when the
monitored component is within the performance specifications for
components aged to the end of the full useful life, and</li>
<li>the manufacturer has provided emission data showing the emission levels
at which the malfunctions are detected.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>17.1.6</dt>
<dd>For 2016 and subsequent model year medium-duty diesel vehicles
(except MDPVs) certified to a chassis dynamometer tailpipe emission
standard, the following monitoring requirements and malfunction criteria
shall apply:
<ol type=A>
<li>Except as provided for in sections (f)(17.1.6)(B) and (C) below, the
monitoring requirements and malfunction criteria in section (f) applicable
to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard shall apply.</li>
<li>For NMHC catalyst conversion efficiency monitoring (section (f)(1.2.2)),
the manufacturer shall detect an NMHC catalyst malfunction when the
catalyst conversion capability decreases to the point that emissions
exceed 1.75 times the applicable FTP NMHC or NOx standards.</li>
<li>For misfire monitoring (section (f)(3)), the manufacturer shall use the
monitoring requirements and malfunction criteria applicable to mediumduty vehicles certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe emission
standard.</li>
</ol>

</dd>
<dt>17.2</dt>
<dd>Whenever the requirements in section (f) of this regulation require a
manufacturer to meet a specific phase-in schedule:
<dl>
<dt>17.2.1</dt>
<dd>The phase-in percentages shall be based on the manufacturer’s
projected sales volume for all vehicles subject to the requirements of title
13, CCR section 1968.2 unless specifically stated otherwise in section (f).</dd>
<dt>17.2.2</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may use an alternate phase-in schedule in lieu of the
required phase-in schedule if the alternate phase -in schedule provides for
equivalent compliance volume as defined in section (c) except as
specifically noted for the phase-in for in-use monitor performance ratio
monitoring conditions in section (d)(3.2) and the PM filter monitor in
section (f)(9.2.1)(A).</dd>
<dt>17.2.3</dt>
<dd>Small volume manufacturers may use an alternate phase-in schedule in
accordance with section (f)(17.2.2) in lieu of the required phase-in
schedule or may use a different schedule as follows:
<ol type=A>
<li>For the diesel PM filter monitor phase-in schedule in section
(f)(9.2.1)(A)(iii), the manufacturer may use the malfunction criteria in
section (f)(9.2.1)(A)(ii)c. for all 2014 and 2015 model year medium-duty
vehicles in lieu of the malfunction criteria and required phase-in schedule
in section (f)(9.2.1)(A)(iii).</li>
<li>For phase-in schedules not listed in section (f)(17.2.3)(A) above, the
manufacturer may meet the requirement on all vehicles by the final year of
the phase-in in lieu of meeting the specific phase-in requirements for each
model year.</li>

<dt>17.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to disable an OBD II
system monitor at ambient temperatures below twenty degrees Fahrenheit
(20?F) (low ambient temperature conditions may be determined based on
intake air or engine coolant temperature) or at elevations above 8000 feet
above sea level. The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer has provided data and/or an engineering
evaluation that demonstrate that monitoring during the conditions would be
unreliable. A manufacturer may further request, and the Executive Officer
shall approve, that an OBD II system monitor be disabled at other ambient
temperatures upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstr ated with
data and/or an engineering evaluation that misdiagnosis would occur at the
ambient temperatures because of its effect on the component itself (e.g.,
component freezing).</dd>
<dt>17.4</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to disable monitoring
systems that can be affected by low fuel level or running out of fuel (e.g.,
misfire detection) when the fuel level is 15 percent or less of the nominal
capacity of the fuel tank. The Executive Officer shall approve the request
upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or an
engineering evaluation that demonstrate that monitoring at the fuel levels
would be unreliable.</dd>
<dt>17.5</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may disable monitoring systems that can be affected by
vehicle battery or system voltage levels.
<dl>
<dt>17.5.1</dt>
<dd>For monitoring systems affected by low vehicle battery or system
voltages, manufacturers may disable monitoring systems when the battery
or system voltage is below 11.0 Volts. Manufacturers may request
Executive Officer approval to utilize a voltage threshold higher than 11.0
Volts to disable system monitoring. The Executive Officer shall approve
the request upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data
and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that monitoring at the
voltages would be unreliable and that either operation of a vehicle below
the disablement criteria for extended periods of time is unlikely or the
OBD II system monitors the battery or system voltage and will detect a
malfunction at the voltage used to disable other monitors.</dd>
<dt>17.5.2</dt>
<dd>For monitoring systems affected by high vehicle battery or system
voltages, manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to
disable monitoring systems when the battery or system voltage exceeds a
manufacturer-defined voltage. The Executive Officer shall approve the
request upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data
and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that monitoring above
the manufacturer-defined voltage would be unreliable and that either the
electrical charging system/alternator warning light is illuminated (or voltage
gauge is in the “red zone”) or that the OBD II system monitors the battery
or system voltage and will detect a malfunction at the voltage used to
disable other monitors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>17.6</dt>
<dd>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable monitors
that can be affected by PTO activation on vehicles designed to accommodate
the installation of PTO units (as defined in section (c)).
<dl>
<dt>17.6.1</dt>
<dd>Except as allowed in section (g)(17.6.2) below, a manufacturer may
request Executive Officer approval to disable an affected monitor provided
disablement occurs only while the PTO unit is active and the OBD II
readiness status (specified under section (g)(4.1)) and PTO activation
time are appropriately tracked and erased as described in this  section.
The Executive Officer shall approve the request for disablement based on
the manufacturer’s demonstration that the affected monitor cannot
robustly detect malfunctions (e.g., cannot avoid false passes or false
indications of malfunctions) while the PTO unit is active. The OBD II
system shall track the cumulative engine runtime with PTO active and
clear OBD II readiness status (i.e., set all monitors to indicate “not
complete”) no later than the start of the next ignition cycle if 750 minutes
of cumulative engine runtime with PTO active has occurred since the last
time the affected monitor has determined the component or system
monitored by the affected monitor is or is not malfunctioning (i.e., has
completed). The PTO timer shall pause whenever PTO changes from
active to not active and resume counting when PTO is re-activated. The
timer shall be reset to zero after the affected monitor has completed and
no later than the start of the next ignition cycle. Once the PTO timer has
reached 750 minutes and the OBD II readiness status has been cleared,
the PTO timer may not cause the OBD system to clear the readiness
status again until after the PTO timer has reset to zero (after the monitor
has completed) and again reached 750 minutes.</dd>
<dt>17.6.2.</dt>
<dd>In lieu of requesting Executive Officer approval for disabling an affected
monitor according to section (f)(17.6.1) above, a manufacturer may
disable affected monitors, provided disablement occurs only while the
PTO unit is active, and the OBD II readiness status is cleared by the onboard computer (i.e., all monitors set to indicate “not complete”) while the
PTO unit is activated. If the disablement occurs, the readiness status may
be restored to its state prior to PTO activation when the disablement ends.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>17.7</dt>
<dd>Whenever the requirements in section (f) of this regulation require monitoring
“to the extent feasible”, the manufacturer shall submit its proposed monitor (s)
for Executive Officer approval. The Executive Officer shall  approve the
proposal upon determining that the proposed monitor(s) meets the criteria of
“to the extent feasible” by considering the best available monitoring
technology to the extent that it is known or should have been known to the
manufacturer and given the limitations of the manufacturer’s existing
hardware, the extent and degree to which the monitoring requirements are
met in full, the limitations of the monitoring necessary to prevent significant
errors of commission and omission, and the extent to which the manufacturer
has considered and pursued alternative monitoring concepts to meet the
requirements in full. The manufacturer’s consideration and pursuit of
alternative monitoring concepts shall include evaluation of other modifications
to the proposed monitor(s), the monitored components themselve s, and other
monitors that use the monitored components (e.g., altering other monitors to
lessen the sensitivity and reliance on the component or characteristic of the
component subject to the proposed monitor(s)).</dd>
