<dd>Exhaust Gas Sensors
<ol type=A>
<li>Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in sections (f)(5.2.1)(A)(i), (5.2.1)(B)(i), (5.2.2)(A), and (5.2.2)(D)
(e.g., sensor performance faults) in accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and
(d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements). For all 2010 and subsequent
model year vehicles, for purposes of tracking and reporting as required in
section (d)(3.2.2), all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in
sections (f)(5.2.1)(A)(i), (5.2.1)(B)(i), (5.2.2)(A), and for 2016 and
subsequent model year medium-duty vehicles, section (f)(5.2.2)(D) shall
be tracked separately but reported as a single set of values as specified in
section (d)(5.2.2).</li>
<li>Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in sections (f)(5.2.1)(A)(iv) and (5.2.1)(B)(iv) (e.g., monitoring
capability) in accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum
ratio requirements) with the exception that monitoring shall occur every
time the monitoring conditions are met during the driving cycle in lieu of
once per driving cycle as required in section (d)(3.1.2).</li>
<li>Except as provided in section (f)(5.3.1)(D), monitoring for malfunctions
identified in sections (f)(5.2.1)(A)(ii), (5.2.1)(A)(iii), (5.2.1)(B)(ii),
(5.2.1)(B)(iii), (5.2.2)(B), and (5.2.2)(C) (i.e., circuit continuity, out-ofrange, and open-loop malfunctions) shall be conducted continuously.</li>
<li>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable
continuous exhaust gas sensor monitoring when an exhaust gas sensor
malfunction cannot be distinguished from other effects (e.g., disable outof-range low monitoring during fuel cut conditions). The Executive Officer
shall approve the disablement upon determining that the manufacturer
has submitted test data and/or documentation that demonstrate a properly
functioning sensor cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning sens or
and that the disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for
avoiding false detection.</li>

<li>Manufacturers shall define monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in section (f)(5.2.4)(A) (i.e., sensor heater performance) in
accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio
requirements).</li>
<li>Monitoring for malfunctions identified in section (f)(5.2.4)(B) (i.e., circuit
malfunctions) shall be conducted continuously.</li>
