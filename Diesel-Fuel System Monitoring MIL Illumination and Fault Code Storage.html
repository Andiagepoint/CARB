<dt>4.4.1</dt>
<dd>General requirements for MIL illumination and fault code storage are set
forth in section (d)(2).</dd>
<dt>4.4.2</dt>
<dd>Additionally, for malfunctions identified in section (f)(4.2.1) (i.e., fuel
pressure control) on all 2010 and subsequent model year vehicles:
<ol type=A>
<li>A pending fault code shall be stored immediately upon the fuel system
exceeding the malfunction criteria established pursuant to section
(f)(4.2.1).</li>
<li>Except as provided below, if a pending fault code is stored, the OBD II
system shall immediately illuminate the MIL and store a confirmed fault
code if a malfunction is again detected during either of the following two
events: (a) the driving cycle immediately following the storage of the
pending fault code, regardless of the conditions encountered during the
driving cycle; or (b) on the next driving cycle in which similar conditions
(see section (c)) to those that occurred when the pending fault code was
stored are encountered.</li>
<li>The pending fault code may be erased at the end of the next driving cycle
in which similar conditions have been en countered without an exceedance
of the specified fuel system malfunction criteria. The pending code may
also be erased if similar conditions are not encountered during the 80
driving cycles immediately after the initial detection of a malfunction for
which the pending code was set.</li>
<li>Storage of freeze frame conditions.
(i) A manufacturer shall store and erase freeze frame conditions either in
conjunction with storing and erasing a pending fault code or in
conjunction with storing and erasing a confirmed fault code.
(ii) If freeze frame conditions are stored for a malfunction other than
misfire (see section (f)(3)) or fuel system malfunction when a fault
code is stored as specified in section (f)(4.4.2) above, the stored
freeze frame information shall be replaced with freeze frame
information regarding the fuel system malfunction.</li>
<li>Storage of fuel system conditions for determining similar conditions of
operation.
(i) Upon detection of a fuel system malfunction under section (f)(4.4.2),
the OBD II system shall store the engine speed, load, and warm-up
status of the first fuel system malfunction that resulted in the storage of
the pending fault code.
(ii) The manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to use an
alternate definition of similar conditions in lieu of the definition
specified in section (c). The Executive Officer shall approve the
alternate definition upon the manufacturer providing data or analysis
demonstrating that the alternate definition provides for equivalent
robustness in detection of fuel system faults that vary in severity
depending on engine speed, load, and/or warm-up status.</li>
<li>Extinguishing the MIL. The MIL may be extinguished after three
sequential driving cycles in which similar conditions have been
encountered without a malfunction of the fuel system.</li>
