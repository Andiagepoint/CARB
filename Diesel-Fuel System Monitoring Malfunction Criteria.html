<dd>Fuel system pressure control:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the fuel system pressure
control system (e.g., fuel, hydraulic fluid) prior to any failure or
deterioration that would cause a vehicle’s NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM
emissions to exceed:
<ol type=i>
<li>For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 3.0 times the applicable FTP standards for 2004 through 2009
model year vehicles;
b. 2.0 times the applicable FTP standards for 2010 through 2012
model year vehicles; and
c. 1.5 times the applicable FTP NMHC, CO, or NOx standards or 2.0
times the applicable FTP PM standard for 2013 and subsequent
model year vehicles.</li>
<li>For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 1.5 times any of the applicable NMHC, CO, and NOx standards or
0.03 g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable cycle emission
test for 2007 and subsequent model year vehicles certified to an
engine dynamometer tailpipe NOx emission standard of greater
than 0.50 g/bhp-hr NOx;
b. 2.5 times any of the applicable NMHC or CO standards, the
applicable NOx standard by more than 0.3 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause
NOx emissions to exceed 0.5 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission
standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test, or 0.03 g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable
cycle emission test for 2007 through 2012 model year vehicles
certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe NOx emission standard
of less than or equal to 0.50 g/bhp-hr NOx; and
c. 2.0 times any of the applicable NMHC or CO standards, the
applicable NOx standard by more than 0.2 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause
NOx emissions to exceed 0.4 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission
standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test, or 0.03 g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable
cycle emission test for 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles
certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe NOx emission standard
of less than or equal to 0.50 g/bhp-hr NOx;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of the fuel system
pressure control could result in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding the
applicable malfunction criteria specified in section (f)(4.2.1)(A), the OBD II
system shall detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control
limits such that the commanded fuel system pressure cannot be delivered.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>4.2.2</dt>
<dd>Injection quantity. Additionally, for all 2010 and subsequent model year
vehicles, the fuel system shall be monitored for injection quantity:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the fuel injection system
when the system is unable to deliver the commanded quantity of fuel
necessary to maintain a vehicle’s NMHC, CO, NOx and PM emissions at
or below:
<ol type=i>
<li>For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 3.0 times the applicable FTP standards for 2010 through 2012
model year vehicles; and
b. 1.5 times the applicable FTP NMHC, CO, or NOx standards or 2.0
times the applicable FTP PM standard for 2013 and subsequent
model year vehicles.</li>
<li>For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard, the applicable emission
levels specified in sections (f)(4.2.1)(A)(ii).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of the fuel injection
quantity could result in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding the applicable
malfunction criteria specified in section (f)(4.2.2)(A), the OBD II system
shall detect a malfunction when the system has reached its control limits
such that the commanded fuel quantity cannot be delivered.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>4.2.3</dt>
<dd>Injection Timing. Additionally, for all 2010 and subsequent model year
vehicles, the fuel system shall be monitored for injection timing:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the fuel injection system
when the system is unable to deliver fuel at the proper crank angle/timing
(e.g., injection timing too advanced or too retarded) necessary to maintain
a vehicle’s NMHC, CO, NOx, and PM emissions at or below the applicable
emission levels specified in sections (f)(4.2.2)(A).</li>
<li>For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of the fuel injection timing
could result in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding the applicable malfunction
criteria specified in section (f)(4.2.3)(A), the OBD II system shall detect a
malfunction when the system has reached its control limits such that the
commanded fuel injection timing cannot be achieved.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>4.2.4</dt>
<dd>Feedback control:
<ol type=A>
<li>Except as provided for in section (f)(4.2.4)(B), if the vehicle is equipped
with feedback or feed-forward control of the fuel system (e.g., feedback
control of pressure or pilot injection quantity), the OBD II system shall
detect a malfunction:
(i) If the system fails to begin control within a manufacturer specified time
interval;
(ii) If a failure or deterioration causes open loop or default operation; or
(iii) If control system has used up all of the adjustment allowed by the
manufacturer or reached its maximum authority and cannot achieve
the target.</li>
<li>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to temporarily
disable monitoring for the malfunction criteria specified in section
(f)(4.2.4)(A)(iii) during conditions that a manufacturer cannot robustly
distinguish between a malfunctioning system and a properly operating
system. The Executive Officer shall approve the disablement upon the
manufacturer submitting data and/or analysis demonstrating that the
control system, when operating as designed on a vehicle with all emission
controls working properly, routinely operates during these conditions with
all of the adjustment allowed by the manufacturer used up.</li>
<li>In lieu of detecting the malfunctions specified in sections (f)(4.2.4)(A)(i)
and (ii) with a fuel system-specific monitor, the OBD II system may
monitor the individual parameters or components that are used as inputs
for fuel system feedback control provided that the m onitors detect all
malfunctions that meet the criteria in sections (f)(4.2.4)(A)(i) and (ii).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>4.2.5</dt>
<dd>For purposes of determining the fuel system malfunction criteria in
sections (f)(4.2.1) through (4.2.3) for medium-duty vehicles (including
MDPVs) certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe emission standard,
the manufacturer shall do the following:
<ol type=A>
<li>For 2004 through 2012 model year vehicles, the malfunction criteria shall
be established by using a fault that affects either a single injector or all
injectors equally.</li>
<li>For 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles, for section (f)(4.2.1), the
malfunction criteria shall be established by using a fault that affects all
injectors equally. Additionally, for systems that have single component
failures which could affect a single injector (e.g., systems that build
injection pressure within the injector that could have a single component
pressure fault caused by the injector itself), the malfunction criteria shall
also be established by using a fault that affects a single injector.</li>
<li>For 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles, for sections (f)(4.2.2)
through (4.2.3), the malfunction criteria shall be established by both (1) a
fault that affects all the injectors equally and (2) a fault that affects only
one injector.</li>
