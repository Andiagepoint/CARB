<dt>4.3.1</dt>
<dd>Except as provided in sections (f)(4.3.2) and (f)(4.3.4), the OBD II system
shall monitor continuously for malfunctions identified in sections (f)(4.2.1)
and (f)(4.2.4) (i.e., fuel pressure control and feedback operation).</dd>
<dt>4.3.2</dt>
<dd>For fuel systems that achieve injection fuel pressure within the injector or
increase pressure within the injector (e.g. in the injector of an amplified
common rail system), manufacturers may request Executive Officer
approval to define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified in
sections (f)(4.2.1) in accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e.,
minimum ratio requirements). The Executive Officer shall approve the
monitoring conditions upon the manufacturer submitting data and/or
analysis identifying all possible failure modes and the effect each has
(e.g., failure modes and effects analysis) on fuel pressure across the
entire range of engine operating conditions, and upon the Executive
Officer determining based on the data and/or analysis that the monitoring
conditions allow for robust detection of all causes of fuel pressure
malfunctions.</dd>
<dt>4.3.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in sections (f)(4.2.2) and (f)(4.2.3) (i.e., injection quantity and
timing) in accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum
ratio requirements).  For all 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles, for
purposes of tracking and reporting as required in section (d)(3.2.2), all
monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in sections (f)(4.2.2) and
(f)(4.2.3) shall be tracked separately but reported as a single set of values
as specified in section (d)(5.2.2).</dd>
<dt>4.3.4</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to temporarily
disable continuous monitoring under conditions technically necessary to
ensure robust detection of malfunctions and to avoid false passes and
false indications of malfunctions.  The Executive Officer shall approve the
request upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data
and/or an engineering evaluation which demonstrate that a properly
operating system cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning system
and that the disablement interval is limited only to that which is technically
necessary.</dd>
