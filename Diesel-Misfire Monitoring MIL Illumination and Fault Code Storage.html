<dt>3.4.1</dt>
<dd>General requirements for MIL illumination and fault code storage are set
forth in section (d)(2).</dd>
<dt>3.4.2</dt>
<dd>Additionally, for 2010 and subsequent model year vehicles subject to
(f)(3.2.2):
<ol type=A>
<li>Upon detection of the percentage of misfire specified in section (f)(3.2.2),
the following criteria shall apply for MIL illumination and fault code
storage:
<ol type=i>
<li>A pending fault code shall be stored no later than after the fourth
exceedance of the percentage of misfire specified in section (f)(3.2.2)
during a single driving cycle.</li>
<li>If a pending fault code is stored, the OBD II system shall illuminate the
MIL and store a confirmed fault code within 10 seconds if the
percentage of misfire specified in section (f)(3.2.2) is again exceeded
four times during: (a) the driving cycle immediately following the
storage of the pending fault code, regardless of the conditions
encountered during the driving cycle; or (b) on the next driving cycle in
which similar conditions (see section (c)) to the engine conditions that
occurred when the pending fault code was stored are encountered.</li>
<li>The pending fault code may be erased at the end of the next driving
cycle in which similar conditions to the engine conditions that occurred
when the pending fault code was stored have been encountered
without an exceedance of the specified percentage of misfire. The
pending code may also be erased if similar conditions are not
encountered during the next 80 driving cycles immediately following
initial detection of the malfunction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Storage of freeze frame conditions.
<ol type=i>
<li>The OBD II system shall store and erase freeze frame conditions either
in conjunction with storing and erasing a pending fault code or in
conjunction with storing a confirmed fault code and erasing a
confirmed fault code.</li>
<li>If freeze frame conditions are stored for a malfunction other than a
misfire malfunction when a fault code is stored as specified in section
(f)(3.4.2), the stored freeze frame information shall be replaced with
freeze frame information regarding the misfire malfunction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Storage of misfire conditions for similar conditions determination. Upon
detection of misfire under section (f)(3.4.2), the OBD II system shall store
the following engine conditions: engine speed, load, and warm -up status
of the first misfire event that resulted in the storage of the pending fault
code.</li>
<li>Extinguishing the MIL. The MIL may be extinguished after three
sequential driving cycles in which similar conditions have been
encountered without an exceedance of the specified percentage of
misfire.</li>
