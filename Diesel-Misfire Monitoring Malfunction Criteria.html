<dt>3.2.1</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall detect a misfire malfunction when one or more
cylinders are continuously misfiring.</dd>
<dt>3.2.2</dt>
<dd>Additionally, for all combustion sensor or combustion quality sensorequipped (e.g., for use in homogeneous charge compression ignition
control systems) 2010 and subsequent model year passenger cars, lightduty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis dynamometer tailpipe
emission standard, for all combustion sensor or combustion quality
sensor-equipped 2010 through 2015 model year medium-duty vehicles,
and for 20 percent of 2016 model year, 50 percent of 2017 model year,
and 100 percent of 2018 model year medium-duty vehicles (percentage
based on the manufacturer’s projected California sales volume for all
medium-duty diesel vehicles):
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a misfire malfunction as follows:
(i) For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard, the OBD II system shall
detect a misfire malfunction that would cause a vehicle’s NMHC, CO,
NOx, or PM emissions to exceed1.5 times any of the applicable FTP
standards.
(ii) For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard, the OBD II system shall
detect a misfire malfunction when the percentage of misfire is equal to
or exceeds five percent.</li>
<li>The manufacturers shall evaluate the percentage of misfire as follows:
(i) For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard, manufacturers shall
determine the percentage of misfire evaluated in 1000 revolution
increments that would cause NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM emissions from
an emission durability demonstration vehicle to exceed the levels
specified in section (f)(3.2.2)(A) if the percentage of misfire were
present from the beginning of the test. To establish this percentage of
misfire, the manufacturer shall utilize misfire events occurring at
equally spaced, complete engine cycle intervals, across randomly
selected cylinders throughout each 1000-revolution increment. If this
percentage of misfire is determined to be lower than one percent, the
manufacturer may set the malfunction criteria at one percent.
(ii) For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard, the manufacturer shall
evaluate the percentage of misfire in 1000 revolution increments.</li>
<li>Subject to Executive Officer approval, a manufacturer may employ other
revolution increments. The Executive Officer shall grant approval upon
determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated that the strategy
would be equally effective and timely in detecting misfire.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>3.2.3</dt>
<dd>A malfunction shall be detected if the percentage of misfire established in
section (f)(3.2.2) is exceeded regardless of the pattern of misfire events
(e.g., random, equally spaced, continuous).</dd>
<dt>3.2.4</dt>
<dd>For multiple cylinder misfire situations that result in a misfire rate greater
than or equal to 50 percent of all engine firings, the OBD II system shall
only be required to detect a misfire malfunction for situations that are
caused by a single component failure.</dd>
<dt>3.2.5</dt>
<dd>Upon request by the manufacturer and upon determining that the
manufacturer has submitted data and/or engineering evaluation which
support the request, the Executive Officer shall revise the percentage of
misfire malfunction criteria in section (f)(3.2.2)(A)(ii) upward to exclude
detection of misfire that cannot cause the vehicle’s NMHC, CO, and NOx
emissions to exceed 2.0 times the applicable standards and the vehicle’s
PM emissions to exceed 0.03 g/bhp-hr as measured from an applicable
cycle emission test.</dd>
