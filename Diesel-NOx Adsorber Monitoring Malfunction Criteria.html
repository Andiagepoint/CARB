<dd>NOx adsorber capability:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a NOx adsorber system malfunction when
the NOx adsorber system capability decreases to the point that would
cause a vehicle's NOx or NMHC emissions to exceed:
(i) For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 3.0 times the applicable FTP standards for 2004 through 2009
model year vehicles;
b. 2.5 times the applicable FTP standards for 2010 through 2012
model year vehicles; and
c. 1.75 times the applicable FTP standards for 2013 and subsequent
model year vehicles.
(ii) For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. the applicable NOx standard by more than 0.5 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause
NOx emissions to exceed 0.7 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission
standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test or 3.5 times the applicable NMHC standard for 2007
through 2009 model year vehicles;
b. the applicable NOx standard by more than 0.3 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause
NOx emissions to exceed 0.5 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission
standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test or 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standard for 2010
through 2012 model year vehicles; and
c. the applicable NOx standard by more than 0.2 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause
NOx emissions to exceed 0.4 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission
standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test or 2.0 times the applicable NMHC standard for 2013
and subsequent model year vehicles.</li>
<li>If no failure or deterioration of the NOx adsorber system capability could
result in a vehicle’s NOx or NMHC emissions exceeding the applicable
malfunction criteria specified in section (f)(8.2.1)(A), the OBD II system
shall detect a malfunction when the system has no detectable amount of
NOx adsorber capability.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>8.2.2</dt>
<dd>For systems that utilize active/intrusive injection (e.g., in-cylinder post fuel
injection, in-exhaust air-assisted fuel injection) to achieve desorption of
the NOx adsorber, the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction if any
failure or deterioration of the injection system’s ability to properly regulate
injection causes the system to be unable to achieve desorption of the NOx
adsorber.</dd>
<dt>8.2.3</dt>
<dd>Feedback control:
<ol type=A>
<li>Except as provided for in section (f)(8.2.3)(B), if the vehicle is equipped
with feedback or feed-forward control of the NOx adsorber or
active/intrusive injection system (e.g., feedback control of injection
quantity, time), the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction:
(i) If the system fails to begin control within a manufacturer specified time
interval;
(ii) If a failure or deterioration causes open loop or default operation; or
(iii) If the control system has used up all of the adjustment allowed by the
manufacturer or reached its maximum authority and cannot achieve
the target.</li>
<li>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to temporarily
disable monitoring for the malfunction criteria specified in section
(f)(8.2.3)(A)(iii) during conditions that a manufacturer cannot robustly
distinguish between a malfunctioning system and a properly operating
system. The Executive Officer shall approve the disablement upon the
manufacturer submitting data and/or analysis demonstrating that the
control system, when operating as designed on a vehicle with all emission
controls working properly, routinely operates during these conditions with
all of the adjustment allowed by the manufacturer used up.</li>
<li>In lieu of detecting the malfunctions specified in sections ( f)(8.2.3)(A)(i)
and (ii) with a NOx adsorber-specific monitor, the OBD II system may
monitor the individual parameters or components that are used as inputs
for NOx adsorber or active/intrusive injection system feedback control
provided that the monitors detect all malfunctions that meet the criteria in
sections (f)(8.2.3)(A)(i) and (ii).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>8.2.4</dt>
<dd>For purposes of determining the NOx adsorber system malfunction criteria
in section (f)(8.2.1) for NOx adsorber systems that consist of more than
one NOx adsorber (e.g., two or more adsorbers in series), the
manufacturer shall submit a system aging and monitoring plan to the
Executive Officer for review and approval. The plan shall include the
description and location of each component, the monitoring strategy for
each component and/or combination of components, and the method for
determining the malfunction criteria of section (f)(8.2.1) including the
deterioration/aging process. Executive Officer approval of the plan shall
be based on the representativeness of the aging to real world NOx
adsorber system component deterioration under normal and
malfunctioning engine operating conditions, the effectiveness of the
method used to determine the malfunction criteria of section (f)(8.2.1), the
ability of the component monitor(s) to pinpoint the likely area of
malfunction and ensure the correct components are repaired/replaced inuse, and the ability of the component monitor(s) to accurately verify that
each NOx adsorber system component is functioning as designed and as
required in section (f)(8.2.1).</dd>
