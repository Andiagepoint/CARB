<dt>8.3.1</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in section (f)(8.2.1) (i.e., adsorber capability) in accordance with
sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements). For
purposes of tracking and reporting as required in section (d)(3.2.2), all
monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in sections (f)(8.2.1) shall
be tracked separately but reported as a single set of values as specified in
section (d)(5.2.2).</dd>
<dt>8.3.2</dt>
<dd>Except as provided in section (f)(8.3.3), the OBD II system shall monitor
continuously for malfunctions identified in sections (f)(8.2.2) and (8.2.3)
(e.g., injection function, feedback control).</dd>
<dt>8.3.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to temporarily
disable continuous monitoring under conditions technically necessary to
ensure robust detection of malfunctions and to avoid false passes and
false indications of malfunctions.  The Executive Officer shall approve the
request upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data
and/or an engineering evaluation which demonstrate that a properly
operating system cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning system
and that the disablement interval is limited only to that which is technically
necessary.</dd>
