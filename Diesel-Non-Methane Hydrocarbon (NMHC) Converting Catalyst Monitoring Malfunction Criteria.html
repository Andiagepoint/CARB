<dt>1.2.1</dt>
<dd>For purposes of section (f)(1), each catalyst in a series configuration that
converts NMHC shall be monitored either individually or in combination
with others.</dd>
<dt>1.2.2</dt>
<dd>Conversion Efficiency:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect an NMHC catalyst malfunction when the
catalyst conversion capability decreases to the point that emissions
exceed:
<ol type=i>
<li>For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 5.0 times the applicable FTP NMHC standards for 2004 through
2009 model year vehicles;
b. 3.0 times the applicable FTP NMHC standards for 2010 through
2012 model year vehicles; and
c. 1.75 times the applicable FTP NMHC standards for 2013 and
subsequent model year vehicles.</li>
<li>For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standards for 2007 through 2012
model year vehicles; and
b. 2.0 times the applicable NMHC standards or the applicable NOx
standard by more than 0.2 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause emissions to
exceed 0.4 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission standard is 0.2 g/bhphr) for 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Except as provided below in section (f)(1.2.2)(C), if no failure or
deterioration of the catalyst conversion capability could result in NMHC or
NOx emissions exceeding the applicable malfunction criteria of section
(f)(1.2.2)(A), the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction when the
catalyst has no detectable amount of NMHC or NOx conversion capability.</li>
<li>For 2004 through 2009 model year vehicles, a manufacturer may request
to be exempted from the requirements for NMHC catalyst conversion
efficiency monitoring. The Executive Officer shall approve the request
upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated, through data
and/or engineering evaluation, that the average FTP test NMHC
conversion efficiency of the system is less than 30 percent (i.e., the
cumulative NMHC emissions measured at the outlet of the catalyst are
more than 70 percent of the cumulative engine-out NMHC emissions
measured at the inlet of the catalyst(s)).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>1.2.3</dt>
<dd>Other Aftertreatment Assistance Functions. Additionally, for 2010 and
subsequent model year vehicles, the catalyst(s) shall be monitored for
other aftertreatment assistance functions:
<ol type=A>
<li>For catalysts used to generate an exotherm to assist PM filter
regeneration, the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction when the
catalyst is unable to generate a sufficient exotherm to achieve
regeneration of the PM filter.</li>
<li>For 2015 and subsequent model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks,
and MDPVs certified to a chassis dynamometer tailpipe emission
standard and 2015 and subsequent model year medium-duty vehicles
(including MDPVs) certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe emission
standard, for catalysts used to generate a feedgas constituency to assist
SCR systems (e.g., to increase NO2
concentration upstream of an SCR
system), the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction when the catalyst is
unable to generate the necessary feedgas constituents for proper SCR
system operation.  Catalysts are exempt from this monitoring if both of the
following criteria are satisfied: (1) no malfunction of the catalyst’s feedgas
generation ability can cause emissions to increase by 15 percent or more
of the applicable full useful life standard as measured from an applicable
emission test cycle; and (2) no malfunction of the catalyst’s feedgas
generation ability can cause emissions to exceed the applicable full useful
life standard as measured from an applicable emission test cycle.</li>
<li>For catalysts located downstream of a PM filter and used to convert
NMHC emissions during PM filter regeneration, the OBD II system shall
detect a malfunction when the catalyst has no detectable amount of
NMHC conversion capability.</li>
<li>For catalysts located downstream of an SCR system (e.g., to prevent
ammonia slip), the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction when the
catalyst has no detectable amount of NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM conversion
capability.  Monitoring of the catalyst shall not be required if there is no
measurable emission impact on the criteria pollutants (i.e., NMHC, CO,
NOx, and PM) during any reasonable driving condition where the catalyst
is most likely to affect criteria pollutants (e.g., during conditions most likely
to result in ammonia generation or excessive reductant delivery).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>1.2.4</dt>
<dd>Catalyst System Aging and Monitoring
<ol type=A>
<li>For purposes of determining the catalyst malfunction criteria in sections
(f)(1.2.2) and (1.2.3) for individually monitored catalysts, the manufacturer
shall use a catalyst(s) deteriorated to the malfunction criteria using
methods established by the manufacturer to represent real world catalyst
deterioration under normal and malfunctioning engine operating
conditions.  If the catalyst system contains catalysts in parallel (e.g., a two
bank exhaust system where each bank has its own catalyst), the
malfunction criteria shall be determined with the “parallel” catalysts equally
deteriorated.</li>
<li>For purposes of determining the catalyst malfunction criteria in sections
(f)(1.2.2) and (1.2.3) for catalysts monitored in combination with others,
the manufacturer shall submit a catalyst system aging and monitoring plan
to the Executive Officer for review and approval. The plan shall include
the description, emission control purpose, and location of each
component, the monitoring strategy for each component and/or
combination of components, and the method for determining the
malfunction criteria of sections (f)(1.2.2) and (1.2.3) including the
deterioration/aging process.  If the catalyst system contains catalysts in
parallel (e.g., a two bank exhaust system where each bank has its own
catalyst), the malfunction criteria shall be determined with the “parallel”
catalysts equally deteriorated.  Executive Officer approval of the plan shall
be based on the representativeness of the aging to real world catalyst
system component deterioration under normal and malfunctioning engine
operating conditions, the effectiveness of the method used to determine
the malfunction criteria of section (f)(1.2), the ability of the component
monitor(s) to pinpoint the likely area of malfunction and ensure the correct
components are repaired/replaced in-use, and the ability of the
component monitor(s) to accurately verify that each catalyst component is
functioning as designed and as required in sections (f)(1.2.2) and (1.2.3).</li>
