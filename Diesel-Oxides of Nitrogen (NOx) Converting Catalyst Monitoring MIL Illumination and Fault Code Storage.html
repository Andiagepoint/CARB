<dd>Except as provided below for reductant faults, general requirements for
MIL illumination and fault code storage are set forth in section (d)(2).</dd>
<dt>2.4.2</dt>
<dd>If the OBD II system is capable of discerning that a system fault is being
caused by a empty reductant tank:
<ol type=A>
<li>The manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to delay
illumination of the MIL if the vehicle is equipped with an alternative
indicator for notifying the vehicle operator of the malfunction. The
Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining the
alternative indicator is of sufficient illumination and location to be readily
visible under all lighting conditions and provides equivalent assurance that
a vehicle operator will be promptly notified and that corrective action will
be undertaken.</li>
<li>If the vehicle is not equipped with an alternative indicator and the MIL
illuminates, the MIL may be immediately extinguished and the
corresponding fault codes erased once the OBD II system has verified
that the reductant tank has been properly refilled and the MIL has not
been illuminated for any other type of malfunction.</li>
<li>The Executive Officer may approve other strategies that provide
equivalent assurance that a vehicle operator will be promptly notified and
that corrective action will be undertaken.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>2.4.3</dt>
<dd>The monitoring method for the catalyst(s) shall be capable of detecting all
instances, except diagnostic self -clearing, when a catalyst fault code has
been cleared but the catalyst has not been replaced (e.g., catalyst
overtemperature histogram approaches are not acceptable).</dd>
