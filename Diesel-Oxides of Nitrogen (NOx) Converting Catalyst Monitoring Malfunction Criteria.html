<dd>For purposes of section (f)(2), each catalyst in a series configuration that
converts NOx shall be monitored either individually or in combination with
others.</dd>
<dt>2.2.2</dt>
<dd>Conversion Efficiency:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a NOx catalyst malfunction when the
catalyst conversion capability decreases to the point that NOx or NMHC
emissions exceed:
<ol type=i>
<li>For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 3.0 times the applicable FTP standards for 2004 through 2009
model year vehicles;
b. 2.5 times the applicable FTP standards for 2010 through 2012
model year vehicles; and
c. 1.75 times the applicable FTP standards for 2013 and subsequent
model year vehicles.</li>
<li>For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. the applicable NOx standard by more than 0.5 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause
NOx emissions to exceed 0.7 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission
standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test or 3.5 times the applicable NMHC standard for 2007
through 2009 model year vehicles;
b. the applicable NOx standard by more than 0.4 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause
NOx emissions to exceed 0.6 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission
standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test or 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standard for 2010
through 2012 model year vehicles;
c. the applicable NOx standard by more than 0.3 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause
NOx emissions to exceed 0.5 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission
standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test or 2.0 times the applicable NMHC standard for 2013
through 2015 model year vehicles; and
d. the applicable NOx standard by more than 0.2 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause
NOx emissions to exceed 0.4 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission
standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test or 2.0 times the applicable NMHC standard for 2016
and subsequent model year vehicles.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Except as provided below in section (f)(2.2.2)(C), if no failure or
deterioration of the catalyst NOx or NMHC conversion capability could
result in NOx or NMHC emissions exceeding the applicable malfunction
criteria of section (f)(2.2.2), the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction
when the catalyst has no detectable amount of NOx or NMHC conversion
capability.</li>
<li>For 2004 through 2009 model year vehicles, a manufacturer may request
to be exempted from the requirements for NOx catalyst conversion
efficiency monitoring. The Executive Officer shall approve the request
upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated, through data
and/or engineering evaluation, that the average FTP test NOx conversion
efficiency of the system is less than 30 percent (i.e., the cumulative NOx
emissions measured at the outlet of the catalyst are more than 70 percent
of the cumulative engine-out NOx emissions measured at the inlet of the
catalyst(s)).</li>

<dd>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Other Active/Intrusive Reductant
Injection System Performance:
<ol type=A>
<li>Reductant Delivery Performance:
<ol type=i>
<li>For 2007 and subsequent model year vehicles, the OBD II system
shall detect a system malfunction prior to any failure or deterioration of
the system to properly regulate reductant delivery (e.g., urea injection,
separate injector fuel injection, post injection of fuel, air assisted
injection/mixing) that would cause a vehicle’s NOx or NMHC emissions
to exceed the applicable emission levels specified in sections
(f)(2.2.2)(A).L</li>
<li>If no failure or deterioration of the reductant delivery system could
result in a vehicle’s NOx or NMHC emissions exceeding the applicable
malfunction criteria specified in section (f)(2.2.3)(A)(i), the OBD II
system shall detect a malfunction when the system has reached its
control limits such that it is no longer able to deliver the desired
quantity of reductant.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the catalyst system uses a reductant other than the fuel used for the
engine or uses a reservoir/tank for the reductant that is separate from the
fuel tank used for the engine, the OBD II system shall detect a
malfunction when there is no longer sufficient reductant available to
properly operate the reductant system (e.g., the reductant tank is empty).</li>
<li>If the catalyst system uses a reservoir/tank for the reductant that is
separate from the fuel tank used for the vehicle, the OBD II system shall
detect a malfunction when an improper reductant is used in the reductant
reservoir/tank (e.g., the reductant tank is filled with something other than
the reductant).</li>
<li>Feedback control: Except as provided for in section (f)(2.2.3)(E), if the
vehicle is equipped with feedback or feed-forward control of the reductant
injection, the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction:
<ol type=i>
<li>If the system fails to begin control within a manufacturer specified time
interval;</li>
<li>If a failure or deterioration causes open loop or default operation; or</li>
<li>If the control system has used up all of the adjustment allowed by the
manufacturer or reached its maximum authority and cannot achieve
the target.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to temporarily
disable monitoring for the malfunction criteria specified in section
(f)(2.2.3)(D)(iii) during conditions that a manufacturer cannot robustly
distinguish between a malfunctioning system and a properly operating
system. The Executive Officer shall approve the disablement upon the
manufacturer submitting data and/or analysis demonstrating that the
control system, when operating as designed on a vehicle with all emission
controls working properly, routinely operates during these conditions with
all of the adjustment allowed by the manufacturer used up.</li>
<li>In lieu of detecting the malfunctions specified in sections ( f)(2.2.3)(D)(i)
and (ii) with a reductant injection system-specific monitor, the OBD II
system may monitor the individual parameters or components that are
used as inputs for reductant injection feedback control provided that the
monitors detect all malfunctions that meet the criteria in sections
(f)(2.2.3)(D)(i) and (ii).</li>

<dt>2.2.4</dt>
<dd>Catalyst System Aging and Monitoring
<ol type=A>
<li>For purposes of determining the catalyst malfunction criteria in section
(f)(2.2.2) for individually monitored catalysts, the manufacturer shall use a
catalyst deteriorated to the malfunction criteria using methods established
by the manufacturer to represent real world catalyst deterioration under
normal and malfunctioning engine operating conditions.  If the catalyst
system contains catalysts in parallel (e.g., a two bank exhaust system
where each bank has its own catalyst), the malfunction criteria shall be
determined with the “parallel” catalysts equally deteriorated.</li>
<li>For purposes of determining the catalyst malfunction criteria in section
(f)(2.2.2) for catalysts monitored in combination with others, the
manufacturer shall submit a catalyst system aging and monitoring plan to
the Executive Officer for review and approval. The plan shall include the
description, emission control purpose, and location of each component,
the monitoring strategy for each component and/or combination of
components, and the method for determining the malfunction criteria of
section (f)(2.2.2) including the deterioration/aging process.  If the catalyst
system contains catalysts in parallel (e.g., a two bank exhaust system
where each bank has its own catalyst), the malfunction criteria shall be
determined with the “parallel” catalysts equally deteriorated.  Executive
Officer approval of the plan shall be based on the representativeness of
the aging to real world catalyst system component deterioration under
normal and malfunctioning engine operating conditions, the effectiveness
of the method used to determine the malfunction criteria of section
(f)(2.2.2), the ability of the component monitor(s) to pinpoint the likely  area
of malfunction and ensure the correct components are repaired/replaced
in-use, and the ability of the component monitor(s) to accurately verify that
each catalyst component is functioning as designed and as required in
section (f)(2.2.2).</li>
