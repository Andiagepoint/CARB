<dd>Filtering Performance:
(A) The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction prior to a decrease in the
filtering capability of the PM filter that would cause a vehicle's PM
emissions to exceed:
(i) For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 5.0 times the applicable FTP standard for 2004 through 2009 model
year vehicles;
b. 4.0 times the applicable FTP standard for 2010 th rough 2012 model
year vehicles; and
c. 1.75 times the applicable FTP standard for 2013  and subsequent
model year vehicles.
(ii) For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 0.09 g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable cycle emission
test for 2004 through 2009 model year vehicles;
b. 0.07 g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable cycle emission
test for 2010 through 2012 model year vehicles; and
c. 0.03 g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable cycle emission
test for 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles.
(iii) For 2014 through 2015 model year medium-duty vehicles (including
MDPVs) certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe emission
standard, the manufacturer shall use the malfunction criteria in section
(f)(9.2.1)(A)(ii)c. above without using the provisions of section (f)(17.1)
to exclude specific failure modes on vehicles under one of the
following two options below:
a. At least 20 percent of 2014 model year vehicles and at least 20
percent of 2015 model year vehicles (percentage based on the
manufacturer’s projected California sales volume for all mediumduty diesel vehicles), or
b. At least 50 percent of 2015 model year vehicles (percentage based
on the manufacturer’s projected California sales volume for all
medium-duty diesel vehicles).
(iv) For the phase-in schedules described in section (f)(9.2.1)(A)(iii) above,
the manufacturer may not use an alternate phase-in schedule as
defined in section (c) in lieu of the required phase-in schedules.
(B) If no failure or deterioration of the PM filtering performance could result in
a vehicle’s PM emissions exceeding the applicable malfunction criteria
specified in section (f)(9.2.1)(A), the OBD II system shall detect a
malfunction when no detectable amount of PM filtering occurs.</dd>
<dt>9.2.2</dt>
<dd> Frequent Regeneration:
(A) For 2010 and subsequent model year vehicles, the OBD II system shall
detect a malfunction when PM filter regeneration occurs more frequently
than (i.e., occurs more often than) the manufacturer’s specified
regeneration frequency such that it would cause a vehicle's emissions to
exceed:
(i) For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 3.0 times the applicable FTP NMHC, CO, or NOx standards for
2010 through 2012 model year vehicles; and
b. 1.5 times the applicable FTP NMHC, CO, or NOx standards for
2013 and subsequent model year vehicles.
(ii) For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 2.5 times the applicable NMHC standards or the applicable NOx
standard by more than 0.3 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause NOx emissions to
exceed 0.5 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission standard is 0.2 g/bhphr) as measured from an applicable cycle emission test for 2010
through 2012 model year vehicles; and
b. 2.0 times the applicable NMHC standards or the applicable NOx
standard by more than 0.2 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause NOx emissions to
exceed 0.4 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission standard is 0.2 g/bhphr) as measured from an applicable cycle emission test for 2013
and subsequent model year vehicles.
(B) If no failure or deterioration causes an increase in the PM filter
regeneration frequency that could result in a vehicle’s NMHC, CO, or NOx
emissions exceeding the applicable malfunction criteria specified in
section (f)(9.2.2)(A), the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction when
the PM filter regeneration frequency exceeds the  manufacturer’s specified
design limits for allowable regeneration frequency.</dd>
<dt>9.2.3</dt>
<dd>Incomplete regeneration: For 2010 and subsequent model year vehicles,
the OBD II system shall detect a regeneration malfunction when the PM
filter does not properly regenerate under manufacturer-defined conditions
where regeneration is designed to occur.</dd>
<dt>9.2.4</dt>
<dd>Catalyzed PM Filter:
(A) NMHC conversion: For 2015 and subsequent model year passenger cars,
light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis dynamometer tailpipe
emission standard and 2015 and subsequent model year medium-duty
vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe
emission standard with catalyzed PM filters that convert NMHC emissions,
the OBD II system shall monitor the catalyst function of the PM filter and
detect a malfunction when the NMHC conversion capability decreases to
the point that NMHC emissions exceed the applicable emission levels
specified in section (f)(9.2.2)(A). If no failure or deterioration of the NMHC
conversion capability could result in a vehicle’s NMHC emissions
exceeding these emission levels, the OBD II system shall detect a
malfunction when the system has no detectable amount of NMHC
conversion capability.  PM filters are exempt from this monitoring if both of
the following criteria are satisfied: (1) no malfunction of the PM filter’s
NMHC conversion capability can cause emissions to increase by 15
percent or more of the applicable full useful life standard as measured
from an applicable emission test cycle; and (2) no malfun ction of the PM
filter’s NMHC conversion capability can cause emissions to exceed the
applicable full useful life standard as measured from an applicable
emission test cycle.
(B) Feedgas generation: For 2016 and subsequent model year medium-duty
vehicles with catalyzed PM filters used to generate a feedgas constituency
to assist SCR systems (e.g., to increase NO
2
concentration upstream of
an SCR system), the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction when the
system is unable to generate the necessary feedgas constituents for
proper SCR system operation. Catalyzed PM filters are exempt from this
monitoring if both of the following criteria are satisfied: (1) no malfunction
of the catalyzed PM filter’s feedgas generation ability can cause
emissions to increase by 15 percent or more of the applicable full useful
life standard as measured from an applicable emission test cycle; and (2)
no malfunction of the catalyzed PM filter’s feedgas generation ability can
cause emissions to exceed the applicable full useful life standard as
measured from an applicable emission test cycle.</dd>
<dt>9.2.5</dt>
<dd>Missing substrate: The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction if either
the PM filter substrate is completely destroyed, removed, or missing, or if
the PM filter assembly is replaced with a muf fler or straight pipe. </dd>
<dt>9.2.6</dt>
<dd>Active/Intrusive Injection: For systems that utilize active/intrusive injection
(e.g., in-cylinder post fuel injection, in-exhaust air-assisted fuel injection)
to achieve regeneration of the PM filter, the OBD II system shall detect a
malfunction if any failure or deterioration of the injection system’s ability to
properly regulate injection causes the system to be unable to achieve
regeneration of the PM filter.</dd>
<dt>9.2.7</dt>
<dd>Feedback Control:
(A) Except as provided for in section (f)(9.2.7)(B), if the vehicle is equipped
with feedback or feed-forward control of the PM filter regeneration (e.g.,
feedback control of oxidation catalyst inlet temperature, PM filter inlet or
outlet temperature, in-cylinder or in-exhaust fuel injection), the OBD II
system shall detect a malfunction:
(i) If the system fails to begin control within a manufacturer specified time
interval;
(ii) If a failure or deterioration causes open loop or default operation; or
(iii) If the control system has used up all of the adjustment allowed by the
manufacturer or reached its maximum authority and cannot achieve
the target.
(B) A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to temporarily
disable monitoring for the malfunction criteria specified in section
(f)(9.2.7)(A)(iii) during conditions that a manufacturer cannot robustly
distinguish between a malfunctioning system and a properly operating
system. The Executive Officer shall approve the disablement upon the
manufacturer submitting data and/or analysis demonstrating that the
control system, when operating as designed on a vehicle with all emission
controls working properly, routinely operates during these conditions with
all of the adjustment allowed by the manufacturer used up.
(C) In lieu of detecting the malfunctions specified in sections ( f)(9.2.7)(A)(i)
and (ii) with a PM filter-specific monitor, the OBD II system may monitor
the individual parameters or components that are used as inputs for PM
filter regeneration feedback control provided that the monitors detect all
malfunctions that meet the criteria in sections (f)(9.2.7)(A)(i) and (ii).</dd>
