<dd>Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in sections (f)(9.2.1) through (9.2.6) in accordance with sections
(d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements), with the exception
that monitoring shall occur every time the monitoring conditions are met
during the driving cycle in lieu of once per driving cycle as required in
section (d)(3.1.2).  For all 2010 and subsequent model year vehicles, for
purposes of tracking and reporting as required in section (d)(3.2.2), all
monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in section (f)(9.2.1) shall
be tracked separately but reported as a single set of values as specified in
section (d)(5.2.2).</dd>
<dt>9.3.2</dt>
<dd>Except as provided in section (f)(9.3.3), the OBD II system shall monitor
continuously for malfunctions identified in section (f)(9.2.7) (i.e., PM filter
feedback control).</dd>
<dt>9.3.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to temporarily
disable continuous monitoring under conditions technically necessary to
ensure robust detection of malfunctions and to avoid false passes and
false indications of malfunctions.  The Executive Officer shall approve the
request upon determining that the manufacturer has subm itted data
and/or an engineering evaluation which demonstrate that a properly
operating system cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning system
and that the disablement interval is limited only to that which is technically
necessary.</dd>
