<dd>Target Error: The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction prior to any
failure or deterioration in the capability of the VVT system to achieve the
commanded valve timing and/or control within a crank angle or lift
tolerance that would cause a vehicle's NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM emissions
to exceed:
<ol type=A>
<li>For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
(i) 3.0 times the applicable FTP standards for 2006 through 2009 model
year vehicles;
(ii) 2.5 times the applicable FTP standards for 2010 through 2012 model
year vehicles; and
(iii) 1.5 times the applicable FTP NMHC, CO, or NOx standards or 2.0
times the applicable FTP PM standard for 2013 and subsequent model
year vehicles.</li>
<li>For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
<ol type=i>
<li>1.5 times the applicable NMHC, CO, and NOx standards or 0.03 g/bhphr PM as measured from an applicable cycle emission test for 2006
and subsequent model year vehicles certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe NOx emission standard of greater than 0.50
g/bhp-hr NOx;</li>
<li>2.5 times the applicable NMHC or CO standards, the applicable NOx
standard by more than 0.3 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause NOx emissions to
exceed 0.5 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr)
as measured from an applicable cycle emission test, or 0.03 g/bhp-hr
PM as measured from an applicable cycle emission test for 2006
through 2012 model year vehicles certified to an engine dynamometer
tailpipe NOx emission standard of less than or equal to 0.50 g/bhp -hr
NOx; and</li>
<li>2.0 times the applicable NMHC or CO standards, the applicable NOx
standard by more than 0.2 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause NOx emissions to
exceed 0.4 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission standard is 0.2 g/bhp-hr)
as measured from an applicable cycle emission test, or 0.03 g/bhp-hr
PM as measured from an applicable cycle emission test for 2013 and
subsequent model year vehicles certified to an engine dynamometer
tailpipe NOx emission standard of less than or equal to 0.50 g/bhp -hr
NOx.</li>

<dd>Slow Response: The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction prior to
any failure or deterioration in the capability of the VVT system to achieve
the commanded valve timing and/or control within a time that would cause
a vehicle's emissions to exceed the applicable emission levels specified in
sections (f)(13.2.1).</dd>
<dt>13.2.3</dt>
<dd>For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of the VVT system could
result in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding the levels specified in sections
(f)(13.2.1), the VVT system shall be monitored for proper functional
response in accordance with the malfunction criteria in section (f)(15.2).</dd>
