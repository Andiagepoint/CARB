(4.5.1)  Within ten seconds of a malfunction that disables a monitor required to meet
14
the monitoring conditions in section (d)(3.2.1 ) being detected (i.e., a
pending or confirmed code is stored), the OBDII system shall disable further
incrementing of the corresponding numerator and denominator for each
monitor that is disabled. When the malfunction is no longer detected (i.e., the
pending code is erased through self-clearing or through a scan tool
command), incrementing of all corresponding numerators and denominators
shall resume within ten seconds.
(4.5.2)  Within ten seconds of the start of a PTO (see section (c)) operation that
disables a monitor required to meet the monitoring conditions in section
(d)(3.2.1), the OBDII system shall disable further incrementing of the
corresponding numerator and denominator for each monitor that is disabled.
When the PTO operation ends, incrementing of all corresponding
numerators and denominators shall resume within ten seconds.
(4.5.3) The OBDII system shall disable further incrementing of all numerators and
denominators within ten seconds if a malfunction of any component used to
determine if the criteria in sections (d)(4.3.2)(B) through (D) are satisfied
(i.e., vehicle speed, ambient temperature, elevation, idle operation, engine
cold start, or time of operation) has been detected and the corresponding
pending fault code has been stored. Incrementing of all numerators and
denominators shall resume within ten seconds when the malfunction is no
longer present (e.g., pending code erased through self-clearing or by a scan
tool command).
