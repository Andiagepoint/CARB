<dd>Within ten seconds of a malfunction that disables a monitor required to
meet the monitoring conditions in section (d)(3.2.1) being detected (i.e., a
pending or confirmed code is stored), the OBD II system shall disable
further incrementing of the corresponding numerator and denominator for
each monitor that is disabled. When the malfunction is no longer
detected (i.e., the pending code is erased through self-clearing or through
a scan tool command), incrementing of all corresponding numerators and
denominators shall resume within ten seconds.</dd>

<dd>Within ten seconds of the start of a PTO (see section (c)) operation that
disables a monitor required to meet the monitoring conditions in section
(d)(3.2.1), the OBD II system shall disable further incrementing of the
corresponding numerator and denominator for each monitor that is
disabled. When the PTO operation ends, incrementing of all
corresponding numerators and denominators shall resume within ten
seconds.</dd>

<dt>4.5.3</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall disable further incrementing of all numerators
and denominators within ten seconds if a malfunction of any component
used to determine if the criteria in sections (d)(4.3.2)(B) through (D) are
satisfied (i.e., vehicle speed, ambient temperature, elevation, idle
operation, engine cold start, or time of operation) has been detected (i.e.,
a pending or confirmed fault code has been stored). Incrementing of all
numerators and denominators shall resume within ten seconds when the
malfunction is no longer present (e.g., pending code erased through selfclearing or by a scan tool command).</dd>
