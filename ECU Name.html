The name of each electronic control unit that responds to an
SAE J1978 scan tool with a unique address or identifier shall be
communicated in a standardized format in accordance with SAE J1979 (i.e.,
ECUNAME in Service/Mode $09, InfoType $0A).  Except as specified for
vehicles with more than one engine control unit, communication of the ECU
name in a standardized format is required on 50 percent of 2010, 75 percent
of 2011, and 100 percent of 2012 and subsequent model year vehicles. For
vehicles with more than one engine control unit (e.g., a 12 cylinder engine
with two engine control units, each of which controls six cylinders),
communication of the ECU name is required on all 2010 and subsequent
model year vehicles.
