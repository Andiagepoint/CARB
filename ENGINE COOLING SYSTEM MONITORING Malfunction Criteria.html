<dd>Thermostat
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a thermostat malfunction if, within an
Executive Officer approved time interval after starting the engine, either of
the following two conditions occur:
<ol type=i>
<li>The coolant temperature does not reach the highest temperature
required by the OBD II system to enable other diagnostics;</li>
<li>The coolant temperature does not reach a warmed-up temperature
within 20 degrees Fahrenheit of the manufacturer’s nominal thermostat
regulating temperature. Subject to Executive Officer approval, a
manufacturer may utilize lower temperatures for this criterion upon the
Executive Officer determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated
that the fuel, spark timing, and/or other coolant temperature -based
modifications to the engine control strategies would not cause an
emission increase of 50 or more percent of any of the applicable
standards (e.g., 50 degree Fahrenheit emission test, etc.).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Executive Officer approval of the time interval after engine start shall be
granted upon determining that the data and/or engineering evaluation
submitted by the manufacturer supports the specified times.</li>
<li>With Executive Officer approval, a manufacturer may use alternate
malfunction criteria and/or monitoring conditions (see section (e)(10.3))
that are a function of temperature at engine start on vehicles that do not
reach the temperatures specified in the malfunction c riteria when the
thermostat is functioning properly. Executive Officer approval shall be
granted upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data that
demonstrate that a properly operating system does not reach the
specified temperatures, that the monitor is capable of meeting the
specified malfunction criteria at engine start temperatures greater than
50?F, and that the overall effectiveness of the monitor is comparable to a
monitor meeting these thermostat monitoring requirements at lower
temperatures.</li>
<li>With Executive Officer approval, manufacturers may omit this monitor.
Executive Officer approval shall be granted upon determining that the
manufacturer has demonstrated that a malfunctioning thermostat cannot
cause a measurable increase in emissions during any reasonable driving
condition nor cause any disablement of other monitors.</li>

<dd>ECT Sensor
<ol type=A>
<li>Circuit Continuity. The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction when a
lack of circuit continuity or out-of-range value occurs.</li>
<li>Time to Reach Closed-Loop Enable Temperature.
(i) The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor does
not achieve the stabilized minimum temperature which is needed for
the fuel control system to begin closed-loop operation (closed-loop
enable temperature) within an Executive Officer approved time interval
after starting the engine.
(ii) The time interval shall be a function of starting ECT and/or a function
of intake air temperature and, except as provided below in section
(e)(10.2.2)(B)(iii), may not exceed:
a. two minutes for engine start temperatures at or above 50 degrees
Fahrenheit and five minutes for engine start temperatures at or
above 20 degrees Fahrenheit and below 50 degrees Fahrenheit for
Low Emission Vehicle I applications and 2004 and 2005 model
year Low Emission Vehicle II applications;
b. two minutes for engine start temperatures up to 15 degrees
Fahrenheit below the closed-loop enable temperature and five
minutes for engine start temperatures between 15 and 35 degrees
Fahrenheit below the closed-loop enable temperature for all 2006
through 2008 model year Low Emission Vehicle II applications and
all 2009 and subsequent model year vehicles.
(iii) Executive Officer approval of the time interval shall be granted upon
determining that the data and/or engineering evaluation submitted by
the manufacturer supports the specified times. The Executive Officer
shall allow longer time intervals upon determining that the
manufacturer has submitted data and/or an engineering evaluation
that demonstrate that the vehicle requires a longe r time to warm up
under normal conditions.
(iv) The Executive Officer shall exempt manufacturers from the
requirement of section (e)(10.2.2)(B) if the manufacturer does not
utilize ECT to enable closed loop fuel control.</li>
<li>Stuck in Range Below the Highest Minimum Enable Temperature. To the
extent feasible when using all available information, the OBD II system
shall detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor inappropriately indicates a
temperature below the highest minimum enable temperature required by
the OBD II system to enable other diagnostics (e.g., an OBD II system
that requires ECT to be greater than 140 degrees Fahrenheit to enable a
diagnostic must detect malfunctions that cause the ECT sensor to
inappropriately indicate a temperature below 140 degrees Fahre nheit).
Manufacturers are exempted from this requirement for temperature
regions in which the monitors required under sections (e)(10.2.1) or
(e)(10.2.2)(B) will detect ECT sensor malfunctions as defined in section
(e)(10.2.2)(C).</li>
<li>Stuck in Range Above the Lowest Maximum Enable Temperature.
<ol type=i>
<li>To the extent feasible when using all available information, the OBD II
system shall detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor inappropriately
indicates a temperature above the lowest maximum enable
temperature required by the OBD II system to enable other diagnostics
(e.g., an OBD II system that requires ECT to be less than 90 degrees
Fahrenheit at engine start to enable a diagnostic must detect
malfunctions that cause the ECT sensor to inappropriately indicate a
temperature above 90 degrees Fahrenheit).</li>
<li>Manufacturers are exempted from this requirement for temperature
regions in which the monitors required under sections (e)(10.2.1),
(e)(10.2.2)(B), or (e)(10.2.2)(C) (i.e., ECT sensor or thermostat
malfunctions) will detect ECT sensor malfunctions as defined in
section (e)(10.2.2)(D) or in which the MIL will be illuminated under the
requirements of section (d)(2.2.3) for default mode operation (e.g.,
overtemperature protection strategies).</li>
<li>For Low Emission Vehicle I applications and 2004 and 2005 model
year Low Emission Vehicle II applications only, manufacturers are also
exempted from the requirements of section (e)(10.2.2)(D) for vehicles
that have a temperature gauge (not a warning light) on the instrument
panel and utilize the same ECT sensor for input to the OBD II system
and the temperature gauge.</li>
<li>For 2006 through 2008 model year Low Emission Vehicle II
applications and all 2009 and subsequent model year vehicles,
manufacturers are also exempted from the requirements of section
(e)(10.2.2)(D) for temperature regions where the temperature gauge
indicates a temperature in the red zone (engine overheating zone) for
vehicles that have a temperature gauge (not a warning light) on the
instrument panel and utilize the same ECT s ensor for input to the
OBD II system and the temperature gauge.</li>
