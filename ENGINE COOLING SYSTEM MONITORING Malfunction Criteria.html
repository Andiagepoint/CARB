(10.2.1)  Thermostat
40
(A)  The OBDII system shall detect a thermostat malfunction if, within an
Executive Officer approved time interval after starting the engine, either of
the following two conditions occur:
(i)  The coolant temperature does not reach the highest temperature required
by the OBDII system to enable other diagnostics;
(ii)  The coolant temperature does not reach a warmed-up temperature within
20 degrees Fahrenheit of the manufacturer’s nominal thermostat
regulating temperature.  Subject to Executive Officer approval, a
manufacturer may utilize lower temperatures for this criterion upon the
Executive Officer determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated
that the fuel, spark timing, and/or other coolant temperature-based
modifications to the engine control strategies would not cause an
emission increase of 50 or more percent of any of the applicable
standards (e.g., 50 degree Fahrenheit emission test, etc.).
(B)  Executive Officer approval of the time interval after engine start shall be
granted upon determining that the data and/or engineering evaluation
submitted by the manufacturer supports the specified times.
(C)  With Executive Officer approval, a manufacturer may use alternate
malfunction criteria and/or monitoring conditions (see section (e)(10.3)) that
are a function of temperature at engine start on vehicles that do not reach the
temperatures specified in the malfunction criteria when the thermostat is
functioning properly.  Executive Officer approval shall be granted upon
determining that the manufacturer has submitted data that demonstrate that a
properly operating system does not reach the specified temperatures, that
the monitor is capable of meeting the specified malfunction criteria at engine
start temperatures greater than 50&deg;F, and that the overall effectiveness of the
monitor is comparable to a monitor meeting these thermostat monitoring
requirements at lower temperatures.
(D)   With Executive Officer approval, manufacturers may omit this monitor.
Executive Officer approval shall be granted upon determining that the
manufacturer has demonstrated that a malfunctioning thermostat cannot
cause a measurable increase in emissions during any reasonable driving
condition nor cause any disablement of other monitors.
(10.2.2)  ECT Sensor
(A)  Circuit Continuity. The OBDII system shall detect a malfunction when  a lack
of circuit continuity or out-of-range values occur.
(B)   Time to Reach Closed-Loop Enable Temperature.
(i)  The OBDII system shall detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor does not
achieve the stabilized minimum temperature which is needed for the fuel
control system to begin closed-loop operation (closed-loop enable
temperature) within an Executive Officer approved time interval after
starting the engine. For diesel applications, the minimum temperature
needed for warmed-up fuel control to begin shall be used instead of the
closed-loop enable temperature.
41
(ii)   The time interval shall be a function of starting ECT and/or a function of
intake air temperature and, except as provided below in section
(e)(10.2.2)(B)(iii), may not exceed:
a. two minutes for engine start temperatures at or above 50 degrees
Fahrenheit and five minutes for engine start temperatures at or above
20 degrees Fahrenheit and below 50 degrees Fahrenheit for Low
Emission Vehicle I applications and 2004 and 2005 model year Low
Emission Vehicle II applications;
b.  two minutes for engine start temperatures up to 15 degrees Fahrenheit
below the closed-loop enable temperature and five minutes for engine
start temperatures between 15 and 35 degrees Fahrenheit below the
closed-loop enable temperature for all 2006 and subsequent model
year Low Emission Vehicle II applications.
(iii)  Executive Officer approval of the time interval shall be granted upon
determining that the data and/or engineering evaluation submitted by the
manufacturer supports the specified times. The Executive Officer shall
allow longer time intervals upon determining that the manufacturer has
submitted data and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that
the vehicle requires a longer time to warm up under normal conditions.
(iv)  The Executive Officer shall exempt manufacturers from the requirement
of section (e)(10.2.2)(B) if the manufacturer does not utilize ECT to
enable closed loop fuel control.
(C)   Stuck in Range  Below the Highest Minimum Enable Temperature.  To the
extent feasible when using all available information, the OBDII system shall
detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor inappropriately indicates a
temperature below the highest minimum enable temperature required by the
OBDII system to enable other diagnostics (e.g., an OBDII system that
requires ECT to be greater than 140 degrees Fahrenheit to enable a
diagnostic must detect malfunctions that cause the ECT sensor to
inappropriately indicate a temperature below 140 degrees Fahrenheit).
Manufacturers are exempted from this requirement for temperature  regions
in which the monitors required under sections (e)(10.2.1) or (e)(10.2.2)(B)
will detect ECT sensor malfunctions as defined in section (e)(10.2.2)(C).
(D)   Stuck in Range  Above the Lowest Maximum Enable Temperature.
(i)  To the extent feasible when using all available information, the OBDII
system shall detect a malfunction if the ECT sensor inappropriately
indicates a temperature above the lowest maximum enable temperature
required by the OBDII system to enable other diagnostics (e.g., an
OBDII system that requires ECT to be less than 90 degrees Fahrenheit
at engine start to enable a diagnostic must detect malfunctions that cause
the ECT sensor to inappropriately indicate a temperature above 90
degrees Fahrenheit).
(ii)  Manufacturers are exempted from this requirement for temperature
regions in which the monitors required under sections (e)(10.2.1),
(e)(10.2.2)(B), or (e)(10.2.2)(C) (i.e., ECT sensor or thermostat
malfunctions) will detect ECT sensor malfunctions as defined in section
42
(e)(10.2.2)(D) or in which the MIL will be illuminated under the
requirements of section (d)(2.1.3) for default mode operation (e.g.,
overtemperatureprotection strategies).
(iii)   For Low Emission Vehicle I applications and 2004 and 2005 model year
Low Emission Vehicle II applications only, manufacturers are also
exempted from the requirements of section (e)(10.2.2)(D) for vehicles
that have a temperature gauge (not a warning light) on the instrument
panel and utilize the same ECT sensor for input to the OBDII system and
the temperature gauge.
(iv)  For 2006 and subsequent model year Low Emission Vehicle II
applications, manufacturers are also exempted from the requirements of
section (e)(10.2.2)(D) for temperature regions where the temperature
gauge indicates a temperature in the red zone (engine overheating zone)
for vehicles that have a temperature gauge (not a warning light) on the
instrument panel and utilize the same ECT sensor for input to the OBDII
system and the temperature gauge.
