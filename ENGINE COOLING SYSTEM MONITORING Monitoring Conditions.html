(10.3.1)  Thermostat
(A)  Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in section (e)(10.2.1)(A) in accordance with section (d)(3.1).
Additionally, except as provided for in sections (e)(10.3.1)(B) and (C),
monitoring for malfunctions identified in section (e)(10.2.1)(A) shall be
conducted once per driving cycle on every driving cycle in which the ECT
sensor indicates, at engine start, a temperature lower than the temperature
established as the malfunction criteria in section (e)(10.2.1)(A).
(B)  Manufacturers may disable thermostat monitoring at ambient starting
temperatures below 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
(C)  Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to suspend or disable
thermostat monitoring if the vehicle is subjected to conditions which could
lead to false diagnosis (e.g., vehicle operation at idle for more than 50
percent of the warm-up time, hot restart conditions, etc.). In general, the
Executive Officer shall not approve disablement of the monitor on engine
starts where the ECT at engine start is more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit
lower than the thermostat malfunction threshold temperature determined
under section (e)(10.2.1)(A). The Executive Officer shall approve the request
upon determining that the manufacturer has provided data and/or
engineering analysis that demonstrate the need for the request.
(10.3.2)  ECT Sensor
(A)   Except as provided below in section (e)(10.3.2)(E), monitoring for
malfunctions identified in section (e)(10.2.2)(A) (i.e., circuit continuity and out
of range) shall be conducted continuously.
(B)  Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in section (e)(10.2.2)(B) in accordance with section (d)(3.1).
Additionally, except as provided for in section (e)(10.3.2)(D), monitoring for
malfunctions identified in section (e)(10.2.2)(B) shall be conducted once per
driving cycle on every driving cycle in which the ECT sensor indicates a
43
temperature lower than the closed loop enable temperature at engine start
(i.e., all engine start temperatures greater than the ECT sensor out of range
low temperature and less than the closed loop enable temperature).
(C)  Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in  sections (e)(10.2.2)(C) and (D) in accordance with sections
(d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements).
(D)  Manufacturers may suspend or delay the time to reach closed loop enable
temperature diagnostic if the vehicle is subjected to conditions which could
lead to false diagnosis (e.g., vehicle operation at idle for more than 50 to 75
percent of the warm-up time).
(E)  A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable
continuous ECT sensor monitoring when an ECT sensor malfunction cannot
be distinguished from other effects. The Executive Officer shall approve the
disablement upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted test data
and/or engineering evaluation that demonstrate a properly functioning sensor
cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning sensor and that the
disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false
detection.
