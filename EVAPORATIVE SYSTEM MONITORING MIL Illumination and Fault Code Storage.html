(4.4.1) Except as provided below for fuel cap leaks and alternate statistical MIL
illumination protocols, general requirements for MIL illumination and fault
code storage are set forth in section (d)(2).
(4.4.2) If the OBD II system is capable of discerning that a system leak is being
caused by a missing or improperly secured fuel cap:
(A)   The manufacturer is not required to illuminate the MIL or store a fault code if
the vehicle is equipped with an alternative indicator for notifying the vehicle
operator of the malfunction. The alternative indicator shall be of sufficient
illumination and location to be readily visible under all lighting conditions.
(B)  If the vehicle is not equipped with an alternative indicator and the MIL
illuminates, the MIL may be extinguished and the corresponding fault codes
erased once the OBDII system has verified that the fuel cap has been
securely fastened and the MIL has not been illuminated for any other type of
malfunction.
(C)   The Executive Officer may approve other strategies that provide equivalent
assurance that a vehicle operator will be promptly notified of a missing or
improperly secured fuel cap and that corrective action will be undertaken.
(4.4.3) Notwithstanding section (d)(2.2.3), manufacturers may request Executive
Officer approval to use alternative statistical MIL illumination and fault code
storage protocols that require up to twelve driving cycles on average for
monitoring strategies designed to detect malfunctions specified by section
(e)(4.2.2)(C).  Executive Officer approval shall be granted in accordance with
the bases identified in section (d)(2.2.3) and upon determination that the
manufacturer has submitted data and/or an engineering analysis
demonstrating that the most reliable monitoring method available cannot
reliably detect a malfunction of the specified size without the additional
driving cycles and that the monitoring system will still meet the monitoring
conditions requirements specified in sections (d)(3.1) and (3.2).
