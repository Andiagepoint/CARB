<dt>4.2.1</dt>
<dd>For purposes of section (e)(4), an orifice shall be defined as an O’Keefe
Controls Co. precision metal “Type B” orifice with NPT connections with a
diameter of the specified dimension (e.g., part number B-20-SS for a
stainless steel 0.020 inch diameter orifice).</dd>
<dt>4.2.2</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall detect an evaporative system malfunction when
any of the following conditions exist:
(A) No purge flow from the evaporative system to the engine can be detected
by the OBD II system;
(B) The complete evaporative system contains a leak or leaks that
cumulatively are greater than or equal to a leak caused by a 0.040 inch
diameter orifice; or
(C) The complete evaporative system contains a leak or leaks that
cumulatively are greater than or equal to a leak caused by a 0.020 inch
diameter orifice.</dd>
<dt>4.2.3</dt>
<dd>On vehicles with fuel tank capacity greater than 25.0 gallons, a
manufacturer may request the Executive Officer to revise the orifice size
in sections (e)(4.2.2)(B) and/or (C) if the most reliable monitoring method
available cannot reliably detect a system leak of the magnitudes specified.
The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining that
the manufacturer has provided data and/or engineering analysis that
demonstrate the need for the request.</dd>
<dt>4.2.4</dt>
<dd>Upon request by the manufacturer and upon determining that the
manufacturer has submitted data and/or engineering evaluation which
support the request, the Executive Officer shall revise the orifice size in
38
sections (e)(4.2.2)(B) and/or (C) upward to exclude detection of leaks that
cannot cause evaporative or running loss emissions to exceed 1.5 times
the applicable standards.</dd>
<dt>4.2.5</dt>
<dd>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to revise the
orifice size in section (e)(4.2.2)(B) to a 0.090 inch diameter orifice. The
Executive Officer shall approve the request upon the manufacturer
submitting data and/or engineering analysis and the Executive Officer
finding that:
(A) the monitoring strategy for detecting orifices specified in section
(e)(4.2.2)(C) meets the monitoring conditions requirements of section
(e)(4.3.2); and
(B) the monitoring strategy for detecting 0.090 inch diameter orifices  yields an
in-use monitor performance ratio (as defined in section (d)(4)) that meets
or exceeds 0.620.</dd>
<dt>4.2.6</dt>
<dd>For the 2004 and 2005 model years only, manufacturers that use
separate monitors to identify leaks (as specified in (e)(4.2.2.)(B) or (C)) in
different portions of the complete evaporative system (e.g., separate
monitors for the fuel tank to canister portion and for the canister to purge
valve portion of the system) may request Executive Officer approval to
revise the malfunction criteria in sections (e)(4.2.2)(B) and (C) to identify a
malfunction when the separately monitored portion of the evaporative
system (e.g., the fuel tank to canister portion) has a leak (or leaks) that is
greater than or equal to the specified size in lieu of when the complete
evaporative system has a leak (or leaks) that is greater than or equal to
the specified size. The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer utilized the same monitoring strategy
(e.g., monitoring portions of the complete system with separate monitors)
on vehicles prior to the 2004 model year and that the monitoring strategy
provides further isolation of the malfunction for repair technicians by
utilizing separate fault codes for each monitored portion of the evaporative
system.</dd>
<dt>4.2.7</dt>
<dd>For vehicles that utilize more than one purge flow path (e.g., a turbocharged engine with a low pressure purge line and a high pressure purge
line), the OBD II system shall verify the criteria of (e)(4.2.2)(A) (i.e., purge
flow to the engine) for both purge flow paths. If a manufacturer
demonstrates that blockage, leakage, or disconnection of one of the
purge flow paths cannot cause a measurable emission increase during
any reasonable in-use driving conditions, monitoring of that flow path is
not required.</dd>
