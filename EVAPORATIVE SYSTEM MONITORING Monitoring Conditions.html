<dd>Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in sections (e)(4.2.2)(A) and (B) (i.e., purge flow and 0.040 inch
leak detection) in accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e.,
minimum ratio requirements).</dd>
<dt>4.3.2</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in section (e)(4.2.2)(C) (i.e., 0.020 inch leak detection) in
accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio
requirements). For purposes of tracking and reporting as required in
section (d)(3.2.2), all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in
section (e)(4.2.2)(C) shall be tracked separately but reported as a single
set of values as specified in section (d)(5.2.2).</dd>
<dt>4.3.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may disable or abort an evaporative system monitor when
the fuel tank level is over 85 percent of nominal tank capacity or during a
refueling event.</dd>
<dt>4.3.4</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to execute the
evaporative system monitor only on driving cycles determined by the
manufacturer to be cold starts if the condition is needed to ensure reliable
monitoring. The Executive Officer may not approve criteria that exclude
engine starts from being considered as cold starts solely on the basis that
ambient temperature exceeds (i.e., indicates a higher temperature than)
engine coolant temperature at engine start. The Executive Officer shall
approve the request upon determining that data and/or an engineering
evaluation submitted by the manufacturer demonstrate that a reliable
check can only be made on driving cycles when the cold start criteria are
satisfied.</dd>
<dt>4.3.5</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may temporarily disable the evaporative purge system to
perform an evaporative system leak check.</dd>
