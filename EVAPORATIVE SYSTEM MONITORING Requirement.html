The OBD II system shall verify purge flow from the evaporative
system and shall monitor the complete evaporative system, excluding the
tubing and connections between the purge valve and the intake manifold, for
vapor leaks to the atmosphere. Individual components of the evaporative
system (e.g. valves, sensors, etc.) shall be monitored in accordance with the
comprehensive components requirements in section (e)(15) (e.g., for circuit
continuity, out of range values, rationality, proper functional response, etc.).
Vehicles not required to be equipped with evaporative emission systems shall
be exempt from monitoring of the evaporative system.
