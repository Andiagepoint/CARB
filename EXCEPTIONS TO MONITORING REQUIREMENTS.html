<dd>Except as provided in sections (e)(17.1.1) through (17.1.3) below, upon
request of a manufacturer or upon the best engineering judgment of the ARB,
the Executive Officer may revise the emission threshold for a malfunction on
any diagnostic required in section (e) if the most reliable monitoring method
developed requires a higher threshold to prevent significant errors of
commission in detecting a malfunction.
<dl>
<dt>17.1.1</dt>
<dd>For PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles, the Executive Officer shall approve a
malfunction criteria of 2.5 times the applicable FTP standards in lieu of 1.5
wherever required in section (e).</dd>
<dt>17.1.2</dt>
<dd>For 2004 model year PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles only, the Executive
Officer shall approve monitors with thresholds that exceed 2.5 times the
applicable FTP standard if the manufacturer demonstrates that a higher
threshold is needed given the state of development of the vehicle and that
the malfunction criteria and monitoring approach and technology (e.g.,
fuel system limits, percent misfire, monitored catalyst volume, etc.) are at
least as stringent as comparable ULEV (not ULEV II) vehicles.</dd>
<dt>17.1.3</dt>
<dd>For vehicles certified to Federal Bin 3 or Bin 4 emission standards,
manufacturers shall utilize the ULEV II vehicle NMOG and CO malfunction
criteria (e.g., 1.5 times the Bin 3 or Bin 4 NMOG and CO standards) and
the PC/LDT SULEV II vehicle NOx malfunction criteria (e.g., 2.5 times the
Bin 3 or Bin 4 NOx standards). </dd>
<dt>17.1.4</dt>
<dd>For medium-duty vehicles certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe
emission standard, the manufacturer shall request Executive Officer
approval of a malfunction criterion that is equivalent to that proposed for
each monitor in section (e). The Executive Officer shall approve the
request upon finding that the manufacturer has used good engineering
judgment in determining the equivalent ma lfunction criterion and that the
criterion will provide for similar timeliness in detection of malfunctioning
components.</dd>

(17.1.1) For PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles, the Executive Officer shall approve a
malfunction criteria of 2.5 times the applicable FTP standards in lieu of 1.5
wherever required in section (e).
(17.1.2) For 2004 model year PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles only, the Executive
Officer shall approve monitors with thresholds that exceed 2.5 times the
applicable FTP standard if the manufacturer demonstrates that a higher
threshold is needed given the state of development of the vehicle and that
the malfunction criteria and monitoring approach and technology (e.g.,
fuel system limits, percent misfire, monitored catalyst volume, etc.) are at
least as stringent as comparable ULEV (not ULEV II) vehicles.

(17.1.4) For medium-duty vehicles certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe
emission standard, the manufacturer shall request Executive Officer
approval of a malfunction criterion that is equivalent to that proposed for
each monitor in section (e). The Executive Officer shall approve the
request upon finding that the manufacturer has used good engineering
judgment in determining the equivalent ma lfunction criterion and that the
criterion will provide for similar timeliness in detection of malfunctioning
components.</dd>
<dt>17.2</dt>
<dd>Whenever the requirements in section (e) of this regulation require a
manufacturer to meet a specific phase-in schedule (e.g., (e)(11) cold start
emission reduction strategy monitoring requires 30 percent in 2006 model
year, 60 percent in 2007 model year, and 100 percent in 2008 model year):
<dl>
<dt>17.2.1</dt>
<dd>The phase-in percentages shall be based on the manufacturer’s
projected sales volume for all vehicles subject to the requirements of title
13, CCR section 1968.2 unless specifically stated otherwise in section (e).</dd>
<dt>17.2.2</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may use an alternate phase-in schedule in lieu of the
required phase-in schedule if the alternate phase -in schedule provides for
equivalent compliance volume as defined in section (c) except as
specifically noted for the phase in of in-use monitor performance ratio
monitoring conditions in section (d)(3.2).</dd>
<dt>17.2.3</dt>
<dd>Small volume manufacturers may use an alternate phase-in schedule in
accordance with section (e)(17.2.2) in lieu of the required phase-in
schedule or may meet the requirement on all vehicles by the final year of
the phase-in in lieu of meeting the specific phase -in requirements for each
model year (e.g., in the example in section (e)(17.2), small volume
manufacturers are required to meet 100 percent in the 2008 model year
for cold start emission reduction strategy monitoring, but not 30  percent in
the 2006 model year or 60 percent in the 2007 model year).</dd>
</dl>

(17.2.1) The phase-in percentages shall be based on the manufacturer’s
projected sales volume for all vehicles subject to the requirements of title
13, CCR section 1968.2 unless specifically stated otherwise in section (e).
(17.2.2) Manufacturers may use an alternate phase-in schedule in lieu of the
required phase-in schedule if the alternate phase -in schedule provides for
equivalent compliance volume as defined in section (c) except as
specifically noted for the phase in of in-use monitor performance ratio
monitoring conditions in section (d)(3.2).
(17.2.3) Small volume manufacturers may use an alternate phase-in schedule in
accordance with section (e)(17.2.2) in lieu of the required phase-in
schedule or may meet the requirement on all vehicles by the final year of
the phase-in in lieu of meeting the specific phase -in requirements for each
model year (e.g., in the example in section (e)(17.2), small volume
manufacturers are required to meet 100 percent in the 2008 model year
for cold start emission reduction strategy monitoring, but not 30  percent in
the 2006 model year or 60 percent in the 2007 model year).</dd>
<dt>17.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to disable an OBD II
system monitor at ambient temperatures below twenty degrees Fahrenheit
(20?F) (low ambient temperature conditions may be determined based on
intake air or engine coolant temperature) or at elevations ab ove 8000 feet
above sea level. The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer has provided data and/or an engineering
evaluation that demonstrate that monitoring during the conditions would be
unreliable. A manufacturer may further request, and the Executive Officer
shall approve, that an OBD II system monitor be disabled at other ambient
temperatures upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated with
data and/or an engineering evaluation that misdiagnosis would occur at the
ambient temperatures because of its effect on the component itself (e.g.,
component freezing).</dd>
<dt>17.4</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to disable monitoring
systems that can be affected by low fuel level or running out of f uel (e.g.,
misfire detection) when the fuel level is 15 percent or less of the nominal
capacity of the fuel tank. The Executive Officer shall approve the request
upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or an
engineering evaluation that demonstrate that monitoring at the fuel levels
would be unreliable.</dd>
<dt>17.5</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may disable monitoring systems that can be affected by
vehicle battery or system voltage levels.
<dl>
<dt>17.5.1</dt>
<dd>For monitoring systems affected by low vehicle battery or system
voltages, manufacturers may disable monitoring systems when the battery
or system voltage is below 11.0 Volts. Manufacturers may request
Executive Officer approval to utilize a voltage threshold higher than 11.0
Volts to disable system monitoring. The Executive Officer shall approve
the request upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data
and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that monitoring at the
voltages would be unreliable and that either operation of a vehicle below
the disablement criteria for extended periods of time is unlikely or the
OBD II system monitors the battery or system voltage and will detect a
malfunction at the voltage used to disable other monitors.</dd>
<dt>17.5.2</dt>
<dd>For monitoring systems affected by high vehicle battery or system
voltages, manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to
disable monitoring systems when the battery or system voltage exceeds a
manufacturer-defined voltage. The Executive Officer shall approve the
request upon determining that the manufacturer has s ubmitted data
and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that monitoring above
the manufacturer-defined voltage would be unreliable and that either the
electrical charging system/alternator warning light is illuminated (or voltage
gauge is in the “red zone”) or that the OBD II system monitors the battery
or system voltage and will detect a malfunction at the voltage used to
disable other monitors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>17.6</dt>
<dd>A manufacturer may disable affected monitoring systems in vehicles
designed to accommodate the installation of Power Take-Off (PTO) units (as
defined in section (c)), provided disablement occurs only while the PTO unit
is active, and the OBD II readiness status is cleared by the on-board
computer (i.e., all monitors set to indicate “not complete”) while the PTO unit
is activated (see section (g)(4.1)). If the disablement occurs, the readiness
status may be restored to its state prior to PTO activation when the
disablement ends.</dd>
<dt>17.7</dt>
<dd>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable affected
monitoring systems in vehicles equipped with tire pressure monitoring
systems that cause a vehicle to enter a default mode of operation (e.g.,
reduced top speed) when a tire pressure problem is detected. The Executive
Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer has
submitted data and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that the
default mode can affect monitoring system performance, that the tire
pressure monitoring system will likely result in action by the consumer to
correct the problem, and that the disablement will not prevent or hinder
effective testing in an Inspection and Maintenance program.</dd>
<dt>17.8</dt>
<dd>Whenever the requirements in section (e) of this regulation require monitoring
“to the extent feasible”, the manufacturer shall submit its proposed monitor(s)
for Executive Officer approval. The Executive Officer shall  approve the
proposal upon determining that the proposed monitor(s) meets the criteria of
“to the extent feasible” by considering the best available monitoring
technology to the extent that it is known or should have been known to the
manufacturer and given the limitations of the manufacturer’s existing
hardware, the extent and degree to which the monitoring requirements are
met in full, the limitations of monitoring necessary to prevent significant errors
of commission and omission, and the extent to which the manufacturer has
considered and pursued alternative monitoring concepts to meet the
requirements in full. The manufacturer’s consideration and pursuit of
alternative monitoring concepts shall include evaluation of other modifications
to the proposed monitor(s), the monitored components themselves, and other
monitors that use the monitored components (e.g., altering other monitors to
lessen the sensitivity and reliance on the component or characteristic of the
component subject to the proposed monitor(s)).</dd>
<dt>17.9</dt>
<dd>For 2004 model year vehicles certified to run on alternate fuels,
manufacturers may request the Executive Officer to waive specific monitoring
requirements in section (e) for which monitoring may not be reliable with
respect to the use of alternate fuels. The Executive Officer shall grant the
request upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated that the
use of the alternate fuel could cause false illumination of the MIL even when
using the best available monitoring technologies.</dd>
<dt>17.10</dt>
<dd> For 2004 model year vehicles only, wherever the requirements of section (e)
reflect a substantive change from the requirements of title 13, CCR section
1968.1(b) for 2003 model year vehicles, the manufacturer may request
Executive Officer approval to continue to use the requirements of section
1968.1 in lieu of the requirements of section (e). The Executive Officer shall
approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted
data and/or engineering evaluation that demonstrate that software or
hardware changes would be required to comply with the requirements of
section (e) and that the system complies with the requirements of section
1968.1(b).</dd>
