(18.1)  Except as provided in sections (e)(18.1.1) through (18.1.3) below, upon request
of a manufacturer or upon the best engineering judgment of the ARB, the
Executive Officer may revise the emission threshold for a malfunction on any
check on a Low Emission Vehicle I application or Low Emission Vehicle II
application if the most reliable monitoring method developed requires a higher
threshold to prevent significant errors of commission in detecting a malfunction.
(18.1.1)  For PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles, the Executive Officer shall approve  a
malfunction criteria of 2.5 times the applicable FTP standards in lieu of 1.5
wherever required in section (e).
(18.1.2)  For 2004 model year PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles only, the Executive Officer
shall approve monitors with thresholds that exceed 2.5 times the applicable
FTP standard if the manufacturer demonstrates that a higher threshold is
needed given the state of development of the vehicle and that the malfunction
criteria and monitoring approach and technology (e.g., fuel system limits,
53
percent misfire, monitored catalyst volume, etc.) are at least as stringent as
comparable ULEV (not ULEV II) vehicles.
(18.1.3)  For vehicles certified to Federal Bin 3 or Bin 4 emission standards,
manufacturers shall utilize the ULEV II vehicle NMOG and CO malfunction
criteria (e.g., 1.5 times the Bin 3 or Bin 4 NMOG and CO standards) and the
PC/LDT SULEV II vehicle NOx malfunction criteria (e.g., 2.5 times the Bin 3
or Bin 4 NOx standards).
(18.2)  Whenever the requirements in section (e) of this regulation require a
manufacturer to meet a specific phase-in schedule (e.g., (e)(11) cold start
emission reduction strategy monitoring requires 30 percent in 2006 model year,
60 percent in 2007 model year, and 100 percent in 2008 model year):
(18.2.1) The phase-in percentages shall be based on the manufacturer’s projected
sales volume for all vehicles subject to the requirements of title 13, CCR
section 1968.2 unless specifically stated otherwise in section (e).
(18.2.2) Manufacturers may use an alternate phase-in schedule in lieu of the
required phase-in schedule if the alternate phase-in schedule provides for
equivalent compliance volume as defined in section (c) except as specifically
noted for the phase in of in-use monitor performance ratio monitoring
conditions in section (d)(3.2).
(18.2.3) Small volume manufacturers may use an alternate phase-in schedule in
accordance with section (e)(18.2.2) in lieu of the required phase-in schedule
or may meet the requirement on all vehicles by the final year of the phase-in
in lieu of meeting the specific phase-in requirements for each model year
(e.g., in the example in section (e)(18.2), small volume manufacturers are
required to meet 100% in the 2008 model year for cold start emission
reduction strategy monitoring, but not 30% in the 2006 model year or 60% in
the 2007 model year).
(18.3)  Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to disable an OBDII
system monitor at ambient engine starting temperatures below twenty degrees
Fahrenheit (20&deg;F) (low ambient temperature conditions may be determined
based on intake air or engine coolant temperature at engine starting) or at
elevations above 8000 feet above sea level. The Executive Officer shall
approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer has provided data
and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that monitoring during the
conditions would be unreliable.  A manufacturer may further request, and the
Executive Officer shall approve, that an OBDII system monitor be disabled at
other ambient engine starting temperatures upon determining that the
manufacturer has demonstrated with data and/or an engineering evaluation that
misdiagnosis would occur at the ambient temperatures because of its effect on
the component itself (e.g., component freezing).
(18.4)  Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to disable monitoring
systems that can be affected by low fuel level or running out of fuel (e.g., misfire
detection) when the fuel level is 15 percent or less of the nominal capacity of the
fuel tank. The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining that
the manufacturer has submitted data and/or an engineering evaluation that
demonstrate that monitoring at the fuel levels would be unreliable.
54
(18.5)  Manufacturers may disable monitoring systems that can be affected by vehicle
battery or system voltage levels.
(18.5.1)  For monitoring systems affected by low vehicle battery or system voltages,
manufacturers may disable monitoring systems when the battery or system
voltage is below 11.0 Volts. Manufacturers may request Executive Officer
approval to utilize a voltage threshold higher than 11.0 Volts to disable
system monitoring.  The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or an engineering
evaluation that demonstrate that monitoring at the voltages would be
unreliable and that either operation of a vehicle below the disablement
criteria for extended periods of time is unlikely or the OBDII system monitors
the battery or system voltage and will detect a malfunction at the voltage used
to disable other monitors.
(18.5.2)  For monitoring systems affected by high vehicle battery or system voltages,
manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to disable monitoring
systems when the battery or system voltage exceeds a manufacturer-defined
voltage.  The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining
that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or an engineering evaluation
that demonstrate that monitoring above the manufacturer-defined voltage
would be unreliable and that either the electrical charging system/alternator
warning light is illuminated (or voltage gauge is in the “red zone”) or that the
OBDII system monitors the battery or system voltage and will detect a
malfunction at the voltage used to disable other monitors.
(18.6)  A manufacturer may disable affected monitoring systems in vehicles designed
to accommodate the installation of Power Take-Off (PTO) units (as defined in
section (c)), provided disablement occurs only while the PTO unit is active, and
the OBDII readiness status is cleared by the on-board computer (i.e., all
monitors set to indicate “not complete”) while the PTO unit is activated (see
section (f)(4.1) below). If the disablement occurs, the readiness status may be
restored to its state prior to PTO activation when the disablement ends.
(18.7)  A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable affected
monitoring systems in vehicles equipped with tire pressure monitoring systems
that cause a vehicle to enter a default mode of operation (e.g., reduced top
speed) when a tire pressure problem is detected.  The Executive Officer shall
approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data
and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that the default mode can
affect monitoring system performance, that the tire pressure monitoring system
will likely result in action by the consumer to correct the problem, and that the
disablement will not prevent or hinder effective testing in an Inspection and
Maintenance program.
(18.8)  For 2004 model year vehicles certified to run on alternate fuels, manufacturers
may request the Executive Officer to waive specific monitoring requirements in
section (e) for which monitoring may not be reliable with respect to the use of
alternate fuels. The Executive Officer shall grant the request upon determining
that the manufacturer has demonstrated that the use of the alternate fuel could
55
cause false illumination of the MIL even when using the best available monitoring
technologies.
(18.9)  For 2004 model year vehicles only, wherever the requirements of section (e)
(except for diesel catalyst (section (e)(1.5)) and particulate matter trap (section
(e)(15)) monitoring) reflect a substantive change from the requirements of title
13, CCR section 1968.1(b) for 2003 model year vehicles, the manufacturer may
request Executive Officer approval to continue to use the requirements of
section 1968.1 in lieu of the requirements of section (e). The Executive Officer
shall approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted
data and/or engineering evaluation that demonstrate that software or hardware
changes would be required to comply with the requirements of section (e) and
that the system complies with the requirements of section 1968.1(b).
