<dt>7.2</dt>
<dd>Consistent with the requirements of title 13, CCR section 1968.5(b)(4)(A) for
enforcement OBD II emission testing, the manufacturer shall make available
upon request by the Executive Officer all test equipment (e.g., malfunction
simulators, deteriorated “threshold” components, etc.) necessary to
determine the malfunction criteria in sections (e) and (f) for major monitors
subject to OBD II emission testing as defined in title 13, CCR section 1968.5.
To meet the requirements of this section, the manufacturers shall only be
required to make available test equipment necessary to duplicate “threshold”
testing performed by the manufacturer. This test equipment shall include, but
is not limited to, aged “threshold” catalyst systems and computer equipment
used to simulate misfire, oxygen sensor, fuel system, VVT system, and cold
start reduction strategy system faults. The manufacturer is not required to
make available test equipment for vehicles that exceed the applicable full
useful life age (e.g., 10 years for vehicles certified to a full useful life of 10
years and 100,000 miles).</dd>
