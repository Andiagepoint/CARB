The OBD system shall erase a permanent
fault code under the following conditions:
<dl>
<dt>2.5.1</dt>
<dd>If the OBD II system is commanding the MIL on, the OBD II system shall
erase a permanent fault code only if the OBD II system itself determines
that the malfunction that caused the permanent fault code to be stored is
no longer present and is not commanding the MIL on, pursuant to the
requirements of section (d)(2.3) (which for purposes of this section shall
apply to all monitors).  Erasure of the permanent fault code shall occur in
conjunction with extinguishing the MIL or no later than the start of the first
driving cycle that begins with the MIL commanded off.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.5.2</dt>
<dd>If all fault information in the on-board computer other than the permanent
fault code has been cleared (i.e., through the use of a scan tool or battery
disconnect) and the OBD II system is not commanding the MIL on:
<ol type=A>Except as provided for in sections (d)(2.5.2)(C) through (E), if the monitor
of the malfunction that caused the permanent fault code to be stored is
subject to the minimum ratio requirements of section (d)(3.2) (e.g.,
catalyst monitor, comprehensive component input component rationality
monitors), the OBD II system shall erase the permanent fault code at the
end of a driving cycle if the monitor has run and made one or more
determinations during a driving cycle that the malfunction of the
component or the system is not present and has not made any
determinations within the same driving cycle that the malfunction is
present.</ol>
<ol type=A start=2>
<li>Except as provided for in sections (d)(2.5.2)(D) and (E), if the monitor of
the malfunction that caused the permanent fault code to be stored is not
subject to the minimum ratio requirements of section (d)(3.2) (e.g.,
gasoline misfire monitor, fuel system monitor, comprehensive component
circuit continuity monitors), the OBD II system shall erase the permanent
fault code at the end of a driving cycle if :
<ol type=i>
<li>The monitor has run and made one or more determinations during a
driving cycle that the malfunction of the component or the system is
not present and has not made any determinations within the same
driving cycle that the malfunction is present;</li>
<li>The monitor has not made any determinations that the malfunction is
present subsequent to the most recent driving cycle in which the
criteria of section (d)(2.5.2)(B)(i) are met; and</li>
<li>The following criteria are satisfied on any single driving cycle (which
may be a different driving cycle than that in which the criteria of section
(d)(2.5.2)(B)(i) are satisfied):
<ol type=a>
<li>Except as provided in section (d)(2.5.2)(B)(iii)f. below, cumulative
time since engine start is greater than or equal to 600 seconds;</li>

<li>Except as provided in section (d)(2.5.2)(B)(iii)e. below, cumulative
vehicle operation at or above 25 miles per hour occurs for greater
than or equal to 300 seconds (medium-duty vehicles with diesel
engines certified on an engine dynamometer may use cumulative
operation at or above 1150 rpm in lieu of at or above 25 miles per
hour for purposes of this criteria);</li>
<li>Continuous vehicle operation at idle (i.e., accelerator pedal released
by driver and either vehicle speed less than or equal to one mile
per hour or engine speed less than or equal to 200 rpm above
normal warmed-up idle (as determined in the drive position for
vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission)) for greater than
or equal to 30 seconds; and</li>
<li>For 2013 and subsequent model year engines, the monitor has not
made any determination that the malfunction is present.</li>
<li>For 2004 through 2012 model year medium-duty vehicles with diesel
engines certified on an engine dynamometer, manufacturers may
use diesel engine operation at or above 15 percent calculated load
in lieu of 1150 rpm for the criterion in section (d)(2.5.2)(B)(iii)b.
above.</li>
<li>For hybrid vehicles, manufacturers shall use “cumulative propulsion
system active time” in lieu of “cumulative time since engine start”
for the criterion in section (d)(2.5.2)(B)(iii)a.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Monitors required to use “similar conditions” as defined in section (c)
to store and erase pending and confirmed fault codes may n ot require
that the similar conditions be met prior to erasure of the permanent
fault code.</li></ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type=A start=3><li>For monitors subject to section (d)(2.5.2)(A), the manufacturer may
choose to erase the permanent fault code using the criteria under section
(d)(2.5.2)(B) in lieu of the criteria under section (d)(2.5.2)(A).</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=4><li>For 2009 and 2010 model year vehicles meeting the permanent fault
code requirements of section (d)(2.2.5), manufacturers may request
Executive Officer approval to use alternate criteria to erase the permanent
fault code. The Executive Officer shall approve alternate criteria that:
(i) Will not likely require driving conditions that are longer and more
difficult to meet than those required under section (d)(2.5.2)(B), and
(ii) Do not require access to enhanced scan tools (i.e., tools that are not
generic SAE J1978 scan tools) to determine conditions necessary to
erase the permanent fault code.</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=5><li>If alternate criteria to erase the permanent fault code are approved by the
Executive Officer under section (d)(2.5.2)(D), a manufacturer may
continue to use the approved alternate criteria for 2011 model year
vehicles previously certified in the 2009 or 2010 model year to the
alternate criteria and carried over to the 2011 model year.</li></ol>
