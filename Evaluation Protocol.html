(5.1.1) For all tests conducted under section (g), the MIL shall be illuminated upon
detection of the tested system or component malfunction before the hot start
exhaust test of the complete FTP test (or before the hot start portion of the
last Unified Cycle, if applicable) in accordance with requirements of section
(e).
(5.1.2)  For all tests conducted under section (g), manufacturers may use NonMethane Hydrocarbon (NMHC) emission results in lieu of Non-Methane
Organic Gas (NMOG) emission results for comparison to the applicable FTP
standards or malfunction criteria (e.g., 1.5 times the FTP standards). If
NMHC emission results are used in lieu of NMOG, the emission result shall
be multiplied by 1.04 to generate an equivalent NMOG result before
comparison to the applicable FTP standards.
(5.1.3) If the MIL illuminates prior to emissions exceeding the applicable malfunction
criteria specified in section (e), no further demonstration is required. With
respect to the misfire monitor demonstration test, if a manufacturer has
elected to use the minimum misfire malfunction criteria of one percent as
allowed in section (e)(3.2.2)(A), no further demonstration is required if the
MIL illuminates with misfire implanted at the malfunction criteria limit.
(5.1.4)  If the MIL does not illuminate when the systems or components are set at
their limit(s), the criteria limit or the OBDII system is not acceptable.
(A)   Except for testing of the catalyst system, if the MIL first illuminates after
emissions exceed the applicable malfunction criteria specified in section (e),
the test vehicle shall be  retestedwith the tested system or component
adjusted so that the MIL will illuminate before emissions exceed the
applicable malfunction criteria specified in section (e).  If the component
69
cannot be adjusted to meet this criterion because a default fuel or emission
control strategy is used when a malfunction is detected (e.g., open loop fuel
control used after an O2 sensor malfunction is determined, etc.), the test
vehicle shall be  retestedwith the component adjusted to the worst
acceptable limit (i.e., the applicable monitor indicates the component is
performing at or slightly better than the malfunction criteria). For the OBDI I
system to be  approved, the MIL must not illuminate during this test and the
vehicle emissions must be below the applicable malfunction criteria
specified in section (e).
(B)  In testing the catalyst system, if the MIL first illuminates after emissions
exceed the applicable emission threshold(s) specified in section (e), the
tested vehicle shall be  retested with a less deteriorated catalyst system (i.e.,
more of the applicable engine out pollutants are converted). For the OBDII
system to be approved, testing shall be continued until either of the following
conditions are satisfied:
(i)  The MIL is illuminated and emissions do not exceed the thresholds
specified in section (e); or
(ii)  The manufacturer demonstrates that the MIL illuminates within acceptable
upper and lower limits of the threshold specified in section (e) for MIL
illumination. The manufacturer shall demonstrate acceptable limits by
continuing testing until the test results show:
a. The MIL is illuminated and emissions exceed the thresholds specified
in section (e) by 10 percent or less of the applicable standard (e.g.,
emissions are less than 1.85 times the applicable standard for a
malfunction criterion of 1.75 times the standard); and
b. The MIL is not illuminated and emissions are below the thresholds
specified in section (e) by no more than 20 percent of the standard
(e.g., emissions are between 1.55 and 1.75 times the applicable
standard for a malfunction criterion of 1.75 times the standard).
(5.1.5) If an OBDII system is determined unacceptable by the above cri teria, the
manufacturer may recalibrate and retest the system on the same test vehicle.
In such a case, the manufacturer must confirm, by  retesting, that all systems
and components that were tested prior to  recalibration and are affected by
the recalibration function properly under the OBDII system as  recalibrated
