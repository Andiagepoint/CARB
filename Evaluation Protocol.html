<dd>For all tests conducted under section (h), the MIL shall be illuminated upon
detection of the tested system or component malfunction before the end of
the first engine start portion of the exhaust emission  test (or before the hot
start portion of the last Unified Cycle, if applicable) in accordance with
requirements of sections (e) and (f).</dd>
<dt>6.2</dt>
<dd>For all tests conducted under section (h), manufacturers may use NonMethane Hydrocarbon (NMHC) emission results in lieu of Non-Methane
Organic Gas (NMOG) emission results for comparison to the applicable
standards or malfunction criteria (e.g., 1.5 times the FTP standards). If
NMHC emission results are used in lieu of NMOG, the emission result shall
be multiplied by 1.04 to generate an equivalent NMOG result before
comparison to the applicable standards.</dd>
<dt>6.3</dt>
<dd>If the MIL illuminates prior to emissions exceeding the applicable malfunction
criteria specified in sections (e) and (f), no further demonstration is required.
With respect to the misfire monitor demonstration test, if a manufacturer has
elected to use the minimum misfire malfunction criteria of one percent as
allowed in sections (e)(3.2.2)(A) and (f)(3.2.2)(B), no further demonstration is
required if the MIL illuminates with misfire implanted at the ma lfunction
criteria limit.</dd>
<dt>6.4</dt>
<dd>If the MIL does not illuminate when the systems or components are set at
their limit(s), the criteria limit or the OBD II system is not acceptable.
<dl>
<dt>6.4.1</dt>
<dd>Except for testing of the catalyst (i.e., components monitored under (e)(1),
(f)(2) or (f)(8)) or PM filter system, if the MIL first illuminates after
emissions exceed the applicable malfunction criteria specified in sections
(e) and (f), the test vehicle shall be retested with the tested system or
component adjusted so that the MIL will illuminate before emissions
exceed the applicable malfunction criteria specified in sections (e) and (f).
If the component cannot be adjusted to meet this criterion because a
default fuel or emission control strategy is used when a malfunction is
detected (e.g., open loop fuel control used after an O2 sensor malfunction
is determined, etc.), the test vehicle shall be retested with the component
adjusted to the worst acceptable limit (i.e., the applicable monitor
indicates the component is performing at o r slightly better than the
malfunction criteria). For the OBD II system to be approved, the MIL must
not illuminate during this test and the vehicle emissions must be below the
applicable malfunction criteria specified in sections (e) and (f).</dd>
<dt>6.4.2</dt>
<dd>In testing the catalyst (i.e., components monitored under (e)(1), (f)(2) or
(f)(8)) or PM filter system, if the MIL first illuminates after emissions
exceed the applicable emission threshold(s) specified in sections (e) and
(f), the tested vehicle shall be retested with a less deteriorated catalyst or
PM filter system (i.e., more of the applicable engine out pollutants are
converted or trapped). For the OBD II system to be approved, testing
shall be continued until either of the following conditions are satisfied:
<ol type=A>
<li>The MIL is illuminated and emissions do not exceed the thresholds
specified in sections (e) and (f); or</li>
<li>The manufacturer demonstrates that the MIL illuminates within
acceptable upper and lower limits of the threshold specified in sections (e)
and (f) for MIL illumination. The manufacturer shall demonstrate
acceptable limits by continuing testing until the test results show:
<ol type=i>
<li>The MIL is illuminated and emissions exceed the thresholds specified
in sections (e) and (f) by 25 percent or less of the applicable standard
(e.g., emissions are less than 2.0 times the applicable standard for a
malfunction criterion of 1.75 times the standard); and</li>
<li>The MIL is not illuminated and emissions are below the thresholds
specified in sections (e) and (f) by no more than 25 percent of the
standard (e.g., emissions are between 1.5 and 1.75 times the
applicable standard for a malfunction criterion of 1.75 times the
standard).</li>
</ol>

</dd>
<dt>6.5</dt>
<dd>If an OBD II system is determined unacceptable by the above criteria, the
manufacturer may recalibrate and retest the system on the same test vehicle.
In such a case, the manufacturer must confirm, by retesting, that all systems
and components that were tested prior to recalibration and are affected by
the recalibration function properly under the OBD II system as recalibrated.</dd>
<dt>6.6</dt>
<dd>Where applicable for diesel vehicles, the emission test results shall be
adjusted as required under section (d)(6.2).</dd>
