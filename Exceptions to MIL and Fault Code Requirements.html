For 2004 model year vehicles only, wherever the requirements of section (d)(2)
reflect a substantive change from the MIL and fault code requirements of title 13,
CCR section 1968.1 for 2003 model year vehicles, the manufacturer may
request Executive Officer approval to continue to use the requirements of
section 1968.1 in lieu of the requirements of section (d)(2).  The Executive
Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer has
submitted data and/or engineering evaluation which demonstrate that software
or hardware changes would be required to comply with the requirements of
section (d)(2) and that the system complies with the MIL and fault code
requirements of title 13, CCR section 1968.1.
