<dd>For medium-duty vehicles equipped with engines certified on an engine
dynamometer, a manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to use
both: (1) an alternate diagnostic connector, and emission-related message
structure and format in lieu of the standardization requirements in sections (f)(2)
and (4) that refer to SAE J1962, SAE J1978, and SAE J1979, and (2) an
alternate communication protocol in lieu of the identified protocols in section
(f)(3). The Executive Officer shall approve the request if:
<ol type=A><li>The ARB has adopted an on-board diagnostic regulation for heavy-duty
vehicles and the alternate diagnostic connector, communication protocol,
and emission-related message format and structure requested by the
manufacturer meets the standardization requirements in the on-board
diagnostic regulation for heavy-duty vehicles; or</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=2><li>For 2004 and 2005 model year vehicles only, the alternate diagnostic
connector, communication protocol, and emission-related message format
and structure requested by the manufacturer meet the standardization
requirements of SAE J1939 and the manufacturer has implemented features
(e.g., readiness code indication via the MIL pursuant to section (f)(4.1.3)) that
will allow the vehicle to be tested in a California Inspection and Maintenance
test facility. If the ARB has not adopted a heavy-duty vehicle on-board
diagnostic regulation by July 1, 2004, the Executive Officer shall extend the
provisions of this section through the 2006 model year. The Executive
Officer shall extend the provisions of this section one additional model year
on each subsequent July 1 if the ARB has not adopted a heavy-duty vehicle
on-board diagnostic regulation by that date.</li></ol>

<dd>For 2004 model year vehicles only, wherever the requirements of sections (f)(2)
and (f)(4) reflect a substantive change from the requirements of title 13, CCR
sections 1968.1(e), (f), (k), or (l) for the 2003 model year vehicles, the
manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to continue to use the
requirements of section 1968.1 in lieu of the requirements of sections (f)(2) and
(f)(4).  The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the
manufacturer has submitted data and/or engineering evaluation that
demonstrate that software or hardware changes would be required to comply
with the requirements of sections (f)(2) and (f)(4) and that the system complies
with the requirements of sections 1968.1(e), (f), (k), and (l).</dd>
