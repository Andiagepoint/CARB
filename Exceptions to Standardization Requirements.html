<dd>For medium-duty vehicles equipped with a diesel engine certified on an
engine dynamometer, a manufacturer may request Executive Officer
approval to use both: (1) an alternate diagnostic connector, and emissionrelated message structure and format in lieu of the standardizat ion
requirements in sections (g)(2) and (4) that refer to SAE J1962, SAE J1978,
and SAE J1979, and (2) an alternate communication protocol in lieu of the
identified protocols in section (g)(3). The Executive Officer shall approve the
request if the alternate diagnostic connector, communication protocol, and
emission-related message format and structure requested by the
manufacturer meet the standardization requirements in title 13, CCR section
1971.1 applicable for 2013 and subsequent model year heavy-duty diesel
engines and the information required to be made available in section (g)( 4.1)
through (g)(6) (e.g., readiness status, data stream parameters, permanent
fault codes, engine run time tracking data) is available in a standardized
format through the alternate emission-related message format.

<dd>For 2004 model year vehicles only, wherever the requirements of sections
(g)(2) and (g)(4) reflect a substantive change from the requirements of title
13, CCR sections 1968.1(e), (f), (k), or (l) for the 2003 model year vehicles,
the manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to continue to use
the requirements of section 1968.1 in lieu of the requirements of sections
(g)(2) and (g)(4). The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or engineering
evaluation that demonstrate that software or hardware changes would be
required to comply with the requirements of sections (g)(2) and (g)(4) and that
the system complies with the requirements of sections 1968.1(e), (f), (k), and
(l).</dd>
