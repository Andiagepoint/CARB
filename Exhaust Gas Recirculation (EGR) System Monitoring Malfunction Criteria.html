<dd>Low Flow:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the EGR system at or
prior to a decrease from the manufacturer's specified EGR flow rate that
would cause a vehicle’s NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM emissions to exceed:
<ol type=i>
<li>For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 3.0 times the applicable FTP standards for 2004 through 2009
model year vehicles;
b. 2.5 times the applicable FTP standards for 2010 through 2012
model year vehicles; and
c. 1.5 times the applicable FTP NMHC, CO, or NOx standards or 2.0
times the applicable FTP PM standard for 2013 and subsequent
model year vehicles.</li>
<li>For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard:
a. 1.5 times the applicable FTP standards for 2004 through 2006
model year vehicles;
b. 1.5 times the applicable NMHC, CO, and NOx standards or 0.03
g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable cycle emission test
for 2007 and subsequent model year vehicles certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe NOx emission standard of greater than 0.50
g/bhp-hr NOx;
c. 2.5 times the applicable NMHC or CO standards, the applicable
NOx standard by more than 0.3 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause NOx
emissions to exceed 0.5 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission standard
is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle emission
test, or 0.03 g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test for 2007 through 2012 model year vehicles certified
to an engine dynamometer tailpipe NOx emission standard of less
than or equal to 0.50 g/bhp-hr NOx; and
d. 2.0 times the applicable NMHC or CO standards, the applicable
NOx standard by more than 0.2 g/bhp-hr (e.g., cause NOx
emissions to exceed 0.4 g/bhp-hr if the exhaust emission standard
is 0.2 g/bhp-hr) as measured from an applicable cycle emission
test, or 0.03 g/bhp-hr PM as measured from an applicable cycle
emission test for 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles
certified to an engine dynamometer tailpipe NOx emission standard
of less than or equal to 0.50 g/bhp-hr NOx.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of the EGR system that
causes a decrease in flow could result in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding
the malfunction criteria specified in section (f)(6.2.1)(A), the OBD II
system shall detect a malfunction when either the EGR system has
reached its control limits such that it cannot increase EGR flow to achieve
the commanded flow rate or, for non-feedback controlled EGR systems,
the EGR system has no detectable amount of EGR flow when EGR flow is
expected.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>6.2.2</dt>
<dd>High Flow:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the EGR system,
including a leaking EGR valve (i.e., exhaust gas flowing through the valve
when the valve is commanded closed), at or prior to an increase from the
manufacturer's specified EGR flow rate that would cause a vehicle’s
NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM emissions to exceed the applicable emission
levels specified in sections (f)(6.2.1)(A):</li>
<li>For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of the EGR system that
causes an increase in flow could result in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding
the malfunction criteria specified in section (f)(6.2.2)(A), the OBD II
system shall detect a malfunction when either the EGR system has
reached its control limits such that it cannot reduce EGR flow to achieve
the commanded flow rate or, for non-feedback controlled EGR systems,
the EGR system has maximum detectable EGR flow when little or no
EGR flow is expected.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>6.2.3</dt>
<dd>Slow Response. Additionally, for 2010 and subsequent model year
vehicles, the EGR system shall be monitored for slow response:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the EGR system at or
prior to any failure or deterioration in the EGR system response (e.g.,
capability to achieve the specified flow rate within a manufacturerspecified time) that would cause a vehicle’s NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM
emissions to exceed the applicable emission levels specified in sections
(f)(6.2.1)(A).</li>
<li>The OBD II system shall monitor the EGR system response under both
increasing and decreasing EGR flow rates.  For vehicles in which no
failure or deterioration of the EGR system response could result in an
engine’s emissions exceeding the levels specified in section (f)(6.2.1)(A),
the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the EGR system when no
detectable response to a change in commanded or expected flow rate
occurs</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>6.2.4</dt>
<dd>Feedback control:
<ol type=A>
<li>Except as provided for in section (f)(6.2.4)(B), if the vehicle is equipped
with feedback or feed-forward control of the EGR system (e.g., feedback
control of flow, valve position, pressure differential across the valve via
intake throttle or exhaust backpressure), the OBD II system shall detect a
malfunction:
<ol type=i>
<li>If the system fails to begin control within a manufacturer specified time
interval;</li>
<li>If a failure or deterioration causes open loop or default operation; or</li>
<li>If the control system has used up all of the adjustment allowed by the
manufacturer or reached its maximum authority and cannot achieve
the target.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to temporarily
disable monitoring for the malfunction criteria specified in section
(f)(6.2.4)(A)(iii) during conditions that a manufacturer cannot robustly
distinguish between a malfunctioning system and a properly operating
system. The Executive Officer shall approve the disablement upon the
manufacturer submitting data and/or analysis demonstrating that the
control system, when operating as designed on a vehicle with all emission
controls working properly, routinely operates during these conditions with
all of the adjustment allowed by the manufacturer used up.</li>
<li>In lieu of detecting the malfunctions specified in sections (f)(6.2.4)(A)(i)
and (ii) with an EGR system-specific monitor, the OBD II system may
monitor the individual parameters or components that are used as inputs
for EGR system feedback control provided that the monitors detect al l
malfunctions that meet the criteria in sections (f)(6.2.4)(A)(i) and (ii).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>6.2.5</dt>
<dd>EGR Cooler Performance:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the EGR  cooler system
at or prior to a reduction from the manufacturer's specified cooling
performance that would cause a vehicle’s NMHC, CO, NOx, or PM
emissions to exceed the applicable emission levels specified in sections
(f)(6.2.1)(A).</li>
<li>For vehicles in which no failure or deterioration of the EGR  cooler system
could result in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding the malfunction criteria
specified in section (f)(6.2.5)(A), the OBD II system shall detect a
malfunction when the system has no detectable amount of EGR cooling.</li>
<li>For purposes of determining the EGR cooler performance malfunction
criteria in section (f)(6.2.5)(A) for EGR cooler systems that consist of more
than one cooler (e.g., a pre-cooler and a main cooler, two or more coolers
in series), the manufacturer shall submit an EGR cooler system aging and
monitoring plan to the Executive Officer for review and approval. The plan
shall include the description and location of each component, the
monitoring strategy for each component and combination of components,
and the method for determining the malfunction criteria of section
(f)(6.2.5)(A) including the deterioration/aging process. Executive Officer
approval of the plan shall be based on the representativeness of the aging
to real world EGR cooler system component deterioration under normal
and malfunctioning engine operating conditions and the effectiveness of
the method used to determine the malfunction criteria of section
(f)(6.2.5)(A).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>6.2.6</dt>
<dd>EGR Catalyst Performance: For catalysts located in the EGR system and
used to convert constituents to reduce emissions or protect or extend the
durability of other emission-related components (e.g., to reduce fouling of
an EGR cooler or valve):
<ol type=A>
<li>For 2004 through 2012 model year vehicles, the catalyst shall be
monitored in accordance with the other emission control or source system
monitoring requirements under section (f)(16).</li>
<li>For 2013 and subsequent model year vehicles, except as provided for in
section (f)(6.2.6)(C) below, the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction
when the catalyst has no detectable amount of constituent (e.g.,
hydrocarbons, soluble organic fractions) oxidation.</li>
<li>Monitoring of the catalyst is not required if there is no measurable
emission impact on the criteria pollutants (i.e., NMHC, CO, NOx, and PM)
during any reasonable driving condition in which the catalyst is most likely
to affect criteria pollutants.</li>
