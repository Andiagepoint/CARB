<dt>6.3.1</dt>
<dd>For malfunctions identified in sections (f)(6.2.1) and (f)(6.2.2) (i.e., EGR
low and high flow) manufacturers shall:
<ol type=A>
<li>Define monitoring conditions in accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and
(d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements) for 2004 through 2009 model
year vehicles. For purposes of tracking and reporting as required in
section (d)(3.2.2), all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in
sections (f)(6.2.1) and (f)(6.2.2) shall be tracked separately but reported
as a single set of values as specified in section (d)(5.2.2);</li>
<li>Except as provided in section (f)(6.3.5), ensure that monitoring is
conducted continuously for all 2010 and subsequent model year vehicles.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>6.3.2</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in section (f)(6.2.3) (i.e., slow response) in accordance with
sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements), with the
exception that monitoring shall occur every time the monitoring conditions
are met during the driving cycle in lieu of once per driving cycle as
required in section (d)(3.1.2). For purposes of tracking and reporting as
required in section (d)(3.2.2), all monitors used to detect malfunctions
identified in section (f)(6.2.3) shall be tracked separately but reported as a
single set of values as specified in section (d)(5.2.2).</dd>
<dt>6.3.3</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall monitor continuously for malfunctions identified in
section (f)(6.2.4) (i.e., EGR feedback control).</dd>
<dt>6.3.4</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in section (f)(6.2.5) and (f)(6.2.6) (i.e., cooler performance and
EGR catalyst performance) in accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and
(d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements). For purposes of tracking and
reporting as required in section (d)(3.2.2), all monitors used to detect
malfunctions identified in section (f)(6.2.5) shall be tracked separately but
reported as a single set of values as specified in section (d)(5.2.2).</dd>
<dt>6.3.5</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to temporarily
disable continuous monitoring under specific conditions technically
necessary to ensure robust detection of malfunctions and to avoid false
passes and false indications of malfunctions (e.g., disable EGR low flow
monitoring when no or very little flow is commanded, disable EGR high
and low flow monitoring when freezing may affect performance of the
system). The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or an
engineering evaluation which demonstrate that a properly operating EGR
system cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning EGR system and
that the disablement interval is limited only to that which is technically
necessary.</dd>
