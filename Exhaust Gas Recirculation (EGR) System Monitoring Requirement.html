<dt>6.1.1</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall monitor the EGR system on vehicles
so-equipped for low flow rate, high flow rate, and slow response
malfunctions. For vehicles equipped with EGR coolers (e.g., heat
exchangers), the OBD II system shall monitor the cooler system for
insufficient cooling malfunctions. The individual electronic components
(e.g., actuators, valves, sensors) that are used in the EGR system shall be
monitored in accordance with the comprehensive component
requirements in section (f)(15).</dd>
<dt>6.1.2</dt>
<dd>For vehicles with other charge control strategies that affect EGR flow (e.g.,
systems that modify EGR flow to achieve a desired fresh air flow rate
instead of a desired EGR flow rate), the manufacturer shall submit a
monitoring plan to the Executive Officer for approval. The Executive
Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer
has submitted data and an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that
the monitoring plan is as reliable and effective as the monitoring plan
required for EGR systems under section (f)(6).</dd>
