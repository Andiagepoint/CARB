<dd>Primary Sensors:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction prior to any failure or
deterioration of the oxygen sensor voltage, response rate, amplitude, or
other characteristic(s) (including drift or bias corrected for by secondary
sensors) that would cause a vehicle's emissions to exceed 1.5 times any
of the applicable FTP standards.  For response rate (see section (c)), the
OBD II system shall detect asymmetric malfunctions (i.e., malfunctions
that primarily affect only the lean-to-rich response rate or only the
rich-to-lean response rate) and symmetric malfunctions (i.e., malfunctions
that affect both the lean-to-rich and rich-to-lean response rates).  As
defined in section (c), response rate includes delays in the sensor to
initially react to a change in exhaust gas composition as well as delays
during the transition from a rich-to-lean (or lean-to-rich) sensor output.
For 25 percent of 2011, 50 percent of 2012, and 100 percent of 2013 and
subsequent model year vehicles, the manufacturer shall submit data
and/or engineering analysis to demonstrate that the calibration method
used ensures proper detection of all symmetric and asymmetric response
rate malfunctions as part of the certification application.</li>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect malfunctions of the oxygen sensor caused
by either a lack of circuit continuity or out-of-range values.</li>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the oxygen sensor when
a sensor failure or deterioration causes the fuel system to stop using that
sensor as a feedback input (e.g., causes default or open loop operation)
or causes the fuel system to fail to enter closed-loop operation within a
manufacturer-specified time interval.</li>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the oxygen sensor when
the sensor output voltage, amplitude, activity, or other characteristic s are
no longer sufficient for use as an OBD II system monitoring device (e.g.,
for catalyst monitoring).</li>
</ol>

<dd>Secondary Sensors:
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction prior to any failure or
deterioration of the oxygen sensor voltage, response rate, amplitude, or
other characteristic(s) that would cause a vehicle's emissions to exceed
1.5 times any of the applicable FTP standards.</li>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect malfunctions of the oxygen sensor caused
by a lack of circuit continuity.</li>
<li>Sufficient sensor performance for other monitors.
<ol type=i>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the oxygen sensor
when the sensor output voltage, amplitude, activity, or other
characteristics are no longer sufficient for use as an OBD II system
monitoring device (e.g., for catalyst monitoring).  For this requirement,
“sufficient” is defined as the capability of the worst performing
acceptable sensor to detect the best performing unacceptable other
monitored system or component (e.g., catalyst).</li>
<li>For systems where it is not technically feasible to satisfy the criteria of
section (e)(7.2.2)(C)(i) completely, the OBD II system shall, at a
minimum, detect a slow rich-to-lean response malfunction during a fuel
shut-off event (e.g., deceleration fuel cut event). The rich-to-lean
response check shall monitor both the sensor response time from a
rich condition (e.g., 0.7 Volts) prior to the start of fuel shut-off to a lean
condition (e.g., 0.1 Volts) expected during fuel shut-off conditions and
the sensor transition time in the intermediate sensor range (e.g., from
0.55 Volts to 0.3 Volts).  Monitoring of the rich-to-lean response shall
be phased in on at least 25 percent of the 2009, 50 percent of the
2010, and 100 percent of the 2011 model year vehicles.  For purposes
of this phase-in, vehicles meeting the criteria of section (e)(7.2.2)(C)(i)
shall be counted as vehicles meeting the rich-to-lean response rate
monitoring requirement of section (e)(7.2.2)(C)(ii).</li>
<li>Additionally, for systems where it is not technically feasible to satisfy
the criteria in section (e)(7.2.2)(C)(i), prior to certification of 2009
model year vehicles, the manufacturer must submit a comprehensive
plan to the Executive Officer demonstrating the manufacturer’s efforts
to minimize any gap remaining between the worst performing
acceptable sensor and a sufficient sensor. The plan should include
quantification of the gap and supporting documentation for efforts to
close the gap including sensor monitoring improvements, other system
component monitor improvements (e.g., changes to make the catalyst
monitor less sensitive to oxygen sensor response), and sensor
specification changes, if any. The Executive Officer shall approve the
plan upon determining the submitted information supports the
necessity of the gap and the plan demonstrates that the manufacturer
is taking reasonable efforts to minimize or eliminate the gap in a timely
manner.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The OBD II system shall detect malfunctions of the oxygen sensor
caused by out-of-range values.</li>

<dd>Sensor Heaters:
(A) The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the heater performance
when the current or voltage drop in the heater circuit is no longer within
the manufacturer's specified limits for normal operation (i.e., within the
criteria required to be met by the component vendor for heater circuit
performance at high mileage). Subject to Executive Officer approval,
other malfunction criteria for heater performance malfunctions may be
used upon the Executive Officer determining that the manufacturer has
submitted data and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate the
monitoring reliability and timeliness to be equivalent to the stated criteria
in section (e)(7.2.3)(A).
(B) The OBD II system shall detect malfunctions of the heater circuit including
open or short circuits that conflict with the commanded state of the heater
(e.g., shorted to 12 Volts when commanded to 0 Volts (ground), etc.).</dd>
