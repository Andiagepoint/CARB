<dd>Primary Sensors
(A) Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in sections (e)(7.2.1)(A) and (D) (e.g., proper response rate) in
accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio
requirements). For purposes of tracking and reporting as required in
section (d)(3.2.2), all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in
sections (e)(7.2.1)(A) and (D) shall be tracked separately but reported as
a single set of values as specified in section (d)(5.2.2).
(B) Except as provided in section (e)(7.3.1)(C), monitoring for malfunctions
identified in sections (e)(7.2.1)(B) and (C) (i.e., circuit continuity, out-ofrange, and open-loop malfunctions) shall be:
(i) Conducted in accordance with title 13, CCR section 1968.1 for Low
Emission Vehicle I applications and 2004 and 2005 model year Low
Emission Vehicle II applications;
(ii) Conducted continuously for all 2006 through 2008 model year Low
Emission Vehicle II applications and all 2009 and subsequent model
year vehicles.
(C) A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable
continuous oxygen sensor monitoring when an oxygen sensor malfunction
cannot be distinguished from other effects (e.g., disable out-of-range low
monitoring during fuel cut conditions). The Executive Officer shall
approve the disablement upon determining that the manufacturer has
submitted test data and/or documentation that demonstrate a properly
functioning sensor cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning sensor
47
and that the disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for
avoiding false detection.</dd>

<li>Manufacturers shall define monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in sections (e)(7.2.2)(A) and (C) (e.g., proper sensor activity) in

requirements).  For all 2010 and subsequent model year vehicles meeting
the monitoring requirements of section (e)(7.2.2)(C)(i) or (ii), for purposes
of tracking and reporting as required in section (d)(3.2.2), all monitors
used to detect malfunctions identified in sections (e)(7.2.2)(A) and (C)
