<dt>7.1.1</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall monitor the output voltage, response rate, and
any other parameter which can affect emissions of all primary (fuel
control) oxygen sensors (conventional switching sensors and wide range
or universal sensors) for malfunction.</dd>
<dt>7.1.2</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall also monitor all secondary oxygen sensors
(those used for fuel trim control or as a monitoring device) for proper
output voltage, activity, and/or response rate.</dd>
<dt>7.1.3</dt>
<dd>For vehicles equipped with heated oxygen sensors, the OBD II system
shall monitor the heater for proper performance.</dd>
<dt>7.1.4</dt>
<dd>For other types of sensors (e.g., hydrocarbon sensors, NOx sensors), the
manufacturer shall submit a monitoring plan to the Executive Officer for
approval. The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and an engineering
evaluation that demonstrate that the monitoring plan is as reliable and
effective as the monitoring plan required for conventional sensors under
section (e)(7).</dd>
