For malfunctions described under
section (6.2.1)(C) (i.e., air-fuel ratio cylinder imbalance malfunctions), general
requirements for MIL illumination and fault code storage are set forth in
section (d)(2). For all other fuel system malfunctions, the MIL illumination
and fault code storage requirements are set forth in sections (e)(6.4.1)
through (6.4.6) below.
<dl>
<dt>6.4.1</dt>
<dd>A pending fault code shall be stored immediately upon the fuel system
exceeding the malfunction criteria established pursuant to section (e)(6.2).</dd>
<dt>6.4.2</dt>
<dd>Except as provided below, if a pending fault code is stored, the OBD II
system shall immediately illuminate the MIL and store a confirmed fault
code if a malfunction is again detected during either of the following two
events: (a) the driving cycle immediately following the storage of the
pending fault code, regardless of the conditions encountered during the
driving cycle; or (b) on the next driving cycle in which similar conditions
(see section (c)) to those that occurred when the pending fault code was
stored are encountered.</dd>
<dt>6.4.3</dt>
<dd>The pending fault code may be erased at the end of the next driving cycle
in which similar conditions have been encountered without an exceedance
of the specified fuel system malfunction criteria. The pending code may
also be erased if similar conditions are not encountered during the 80
driving cycles immediately after the initial detection of a malfunction for
which the pending code was set.</dd>
<dt>6.4.4</dt>
<dd>Storage of freeze frame conditions.
<ol type=A>
<li>The OBD II system shall store and erase freeze frame conditions either in
conjunction with storing and erasing a pending fault code or in conjunction
with storing and erasing a confirmed fault code.</li>
<li>If freeze frame conditions are stored for a malfunction other than misfire
(see section (e)(3)) or fuel system malfunction when a fault code is stored
as specified in section (e)(6.4) above, the stored freeze frame information
shall be replaced with freeze frame information regarding the fuel system
malfunction.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>6.4.5</dt>
<dd>Storage of fuel system conditions for determining similar conditions of
operation.
<ol type=A>
<li>Upon detection of a fuel system malfunction under section (e)(6.2), the
OBD II system shall store the engine speed, load, and warm-up status of
the first fuel system malfunction that resulted in the storage of the pending
fault code.</li>
<li>For fuel system faults detected using feedback control that is based on a
secondary oxygen (or equivalent) sensor, the manufacturer may request
Executive Officer approval to use an alternate definition of similar
conditions in lieu of the definition specified in section (c). The Executive
Officer shall approve the alternate definition upon the manufacturer
providing data or analysis demonstrating that the alternate definition
provides for equivalent robustness in detection of fuel system faults that
vary in severity depending on engine speed, load, and/or warm-up status.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>6.4.6</dt>
<dd>Extinguishing the MIL. The MIL may be extinguished after three
sequential driving cycles in which similar conditions have been
encountered without a malfunction of the fuel system.</dd>
