(6.4.1) A pending fault code shall be stored immediately upon the fuel system
exceeding the malfunction criteria established pursuant to section (e)(6.2).
(6.4.2) Except as provided below, if a pending fault code is stored, the OBDII
system shall immediately illuminate the MIL and store a confirmed fault code
if a malfunction is again detected during either of the following two events: (a)
the driving cycle immediately following the storage of the pending fault code,
regardless of the conditions encountered during the driving cycle; or (b) on
the next driving cycle in which similar conditions (see section (c)) to those
that occurred when the pending fault code was stored are encountered.
(6.4.3) The pending fault code may be erased at the end of the next driving cycle in
which similar conditions have been encountered without an exceedance of
the specified fuel system malfunction criteria. The pending code may also
be erased if similar conditions are not encountered during the 80 driving
cycles immediately after the initial detection of a malfunction for which the
pending code was set.
(6.4.4)  Storage of freeze frame conditions.
(A)  A manufacturer shall store and erase freeze frame conditions either in
conjunction with storing and erasing a pending fault code or in conjunction
with storing and erasing a confirmed fault code.
(B)  If freeze frame conditions are stored for a malfunction other than misfire (see
section (e)(3)) or fuel system malfunction when a fault code is stored as
specified in section (e)(6.4) above, the stored freeze frame information shall
be replaced with freeze frame information regarding the fuel system
malfunction.
(6.4.5)  Storage of fuel system conditions for determining similar conditions of
operation. Upon detection of a fuel system malfunction under section
(e)(6.2), manufacturers shall store the engine speed, load, and warm-up
status of the first fuel system malfunction that resulted in the storage of the
pending fault code.
(6.4.6)  Extinguishing the MIL. The MIL may be extinguished after three sequential
driving cycles in which similar conditions have been encountered without a
malfunction of the fuel system.
