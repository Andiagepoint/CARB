<dt>6.2.1</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of the fuel delivery system
when:
<ol type=A>
<li>The fuel delivery system is unable to maintain a vehicle's emissions at or
below 1.5 times any of the applicable FTP standards; or</li>
<li>If equipped, the feedback control based on a secondary oxygen or
exhaust gas sensor is unable to maintain a vehicle’s emissions (except as
a result of a malfunction specified in section (e)(6.2.1)(C)) at or below 1.5
times any of the applicable FTP standards;  or</li>
<li>Except as required in section (e)(6.2.6), for 25 percent of all 2011 model
year vehicles, 50 percent of all 2012 model year vehicles, 75 percent of all
2013 model year vehicles, and 100 percent of all 2014 model year
vehicles, an air-fuel ratio cylinder imbalance (e.g., the air-fuel ratio in one
or more cylinders is different than the other cylinders due to a cylinder
specific malfunction such as an intake manifold leak at a particular
cylinder, fuel injector problem, an individual cylinder EGR runner flow
delivery problem, an individual variable cam lift malfunction such that an
individual cylinder is operating on the wrong cam lift profile, or  other
similar problems) occurs in one or more cylinders such that the fuel
delivery system is unable to maintain a vehicle’s emissions at or below:
4.0 times the applicable FTP standards for PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles and
3.0 times the applicable FTP standards for all other vehicles for the 2011
through 2013 model years; and 1.5 times the applicable FTP standards
for all 2014 and subsequent model year vehicles.  In lieu of using 1.5
times the applicable FTP standards for all 2014 model year applications,
for the 2014 model year only, a manufacturer may continue to use  4.0
times the applicable FTP standards for PC/LDT SULEV II vehicles and  3.0
times the applicable FTP standards for other applications previously
certified in the 2011, 2012, or 2013 model year to 4.0 times or 3.0 times
the applicable FTP standards and carried over to the 2014 model year.</li>

<dt>6.2.2</dt>
<dd>Except as provided for in section (e)(6.2.3) below, if the vehicle is
equipped with adaptive feedback control, the OBD II system shall detect a
malfunction when the adaptive feedback control has used up all of the
adjustment allowed by the manufacturer.</dd>
<dt>6.2.3</dt>
<dd>If the vehicle is equipped with feedback control that is based on a
secondary oxygen (or equivalent) sensor, the OBD II system is not
required to detect a malfunction of the fuel system solely when the
feedback control based on a secondary oxygen sensor has used up all of
the adjustment allowed by the manufacturer. However, i f a failure or
deterioration results in vehicle emissions that exceed the malfunction
criteria in section (e)(6.2.1), the OBD II system is required to detect a
malfunction.</dd>
<dt>6.2.4</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall detect a malfunction whenever the fuel control
system fails to enter closed-loop operation (if employed) within a
manufacturer specified time interval.</dd>
<dt>6.2.5</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may adjust the criteria and/or limit(s) to compensate for
changes in altitude, for temporary introduction of large amounts of purge
vapor, or for other similar identifiable operating conditions when they
occur.</dd>
<dt>6.2.6</dt>
<dd>Notwithstanding the phase-in specified in section (e)(6.2.1)(C), if a vehicle
is equipped with separate EGR flow delivery passageways (internal or
external) that deliver EGR flow to individual cylinders (e.g., an EGR
system with individual delivery pipes to each cylinder), the OBD II system
shall monitor the fuel delivery system for malfunctions specified in section
43
(e)(6.2.1)(C) on all 2011 and subsequent model year vehicles  so
equipped.</dd>
