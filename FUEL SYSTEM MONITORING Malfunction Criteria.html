(6.2.1) The OBDII system shall detect a malfunction of the fuel delivery system
(including feedback control based on a secondary oxygen sensor) when the
fuel delivery system is unable to maintain a vehicle's emissions at or below
1.5 times any of the applicable FTP standards.
(6.2.2) Except as provided for in section (e)(6.2.3) below, if the vehicle is equipped
with adaptive feedback control, the OBDII system shall detect a malfunction
when the adaptive feedback control has used up all of the adjustment
allowed by the manufacturer.
(6.2.3) If the vehicle is equipped with feedback control that is based on a secondary
oxygen (or equivalent) sensor, the OBDII system is not required to detect a
malfunction of the fuel system solely when the feedback control based on a
secondary oxygen sensor has used up all of the adjustment allowed by the
34
manufacturer. However, if a failure or deterioration results in vehicle
emissions that exceed the malfunction criteria in section (e)(6.2.1), the
OBDII system is required to detect a malfunction.
(6.2.4) The OBDII system shall detect a malfunction whenever the fuel control
system fails to enter closed-loop operation (if employed) within a
manufacturer specified time interval.
(6.2.5)  Manufacturers may adjust the criteria and/or limit(s) to compensate for
changes in altitude, for temporary introduction of large amounts of purge
vapor, or for other similar identifiable operating conditions when they occur.
