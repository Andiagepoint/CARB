<dt>4.4.1</dt>
<dd>For all monitored components and systems, stored pending and confirmed
fault codes shall be made available through the diagnostic connector in
accordance with SAE J1979 specifications. Standardized fault codes
conforming to SAE J2012 shall be employed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.4.2</dt>
<dd>The stored fault code shall, to the fullest extent possible, pinpoint the likely
cause of the malfunction. To the extent feasible on all 2005 and subsequent
model year vehicles, manufacturers shall use separate fault codes for every
diagnostic where the diagnostic and repair procedure or likely cause of the
failure is different. In general, rationality and functional diagnostics shall use
different fault codes than the respective circuit continuity diagnostics.
Additionally, input component circuit continuity diagnostics shall use different
fault codes for distinct malfunctions (e.g., out-of-range low, out-of-range high,
open circuit, etc.).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.4.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall use appropriate SAE-defined fault codes of SAE J2012
(e.g., P0xxx, P2xxx) whenever possible. With Executive Officer approval,
manufacturers may use manufacturer-defined fault codes in accordance with
SAE J2012 specifications (e.g., P1xxx). Factors to be considered by the
Executive Officer for approval shall include the lack of available SAE-defined
fault codes, uniqueness of the diagnostic or monitored component, expected
future usage of the diagnostic or component, and estimated usefulness in
providing additional diagnostic and repair information to service technicians.
Manufacturer-defined fault codes shall be used consistently (i.e., the same
fault code may not be used to represent two different failure modes) across a
manufacturer’s entire product line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.4.4</dt>
<dd>A fault code (pending and/or confirmed, as required in sections (d) and (e))
shall be stored and available to an SAE J1978 scan tool within 10 seconds
after a diagnostic has determined that a malfunction has occurred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.4.5</dt>
<dd>Pending fault codes:
<ol type=A>
<li>On all 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles, pending fault codes for all
components and systems (including continuously and non-continuously
monitored components) shall be made available through the diagnostic
connector in accordance with SAE J1979 specifications (e.g., Mode/Service
$07).</li>
</ol>
<ol type=A start=2>
<li>On all 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles, a pending fault code(s)
shall be stored and available through the diagnostic connector for all currently
malfunctioning monitored component(s) or system(s), regardless of the MIL
illumination status or confirmed fault code status (e.g., even after a pending
fault has matured to a confirmed fault code and the MIL is illuminated, a
pending fault code shall be stored and available if the most recent monitoring
event indicates the component is malfunctioning).</li>
</ol>
<ol type=A start=3>
<li>Manufacturers using alternate statistical protocols for MIL illumination as
allowed in section (d)(2.2.3) shall submit to the Executive Officer a protocol
for setting pending fault codes. The Executive Officer shall approve the
proposed protocol upon determining that, overall, it is equivalent to the
requirements in sections (f)(4.4.5)(A) and (B) and that it effectively provides
service technicians with a quick and accurate indication of a pending failure.</li>
