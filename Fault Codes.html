<dt>4.4.1</dt>
<dd>For all monitored components and systems, stored pending, confirmed,
and permanent fault codes shall be made available through the diagnostic
connector in accordance with SAE J1979 specifications. Standardized
fault codes conforming to SAE J2012 shall be employed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.4.2</dt>
<dd>The stored fault code shall, to the fullest extent possible, pinpoint the likely
cause of the malfunction. To the extent feasible on all 2005 and
subsequent model year vehicles, manufacturers shall use separate fault
codes for every diagnostic where the diagnostic and repair procedure or
likely cause of the failure is different. In general,  rationality and functional
diagnostics shall use different fault codes than the respective circuit
continuity diagnostics. Additionally, input component circuit continuity
diagnostics shall use different fault codes for distinct malfunctions (e.g.,
out-of-range low, out-of-range high, open circuit, etc.).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.4.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall use appropriate SAE-defined fault codes of SAE
J2012 (e.g., P0xxx, P2xxx) whenever possible. With Executive Officer
approval, manufacturers may use manufacturer-defined fault codes in
accordance with SAE J2012 specifications (e.g., P1xxx). Factors to be
considered by the Executive Officer for approval shall include the lack of
available SAE-defined fault codes, uniqueness of the diagnostic or
monitored component, expected future usage of the diagnostic or
component, and estimated usefulness in providing additional diagnostic
and repair information to service technicians. Manufacturer-defined fault
codes shall be used consistently (i.e., the same fault code may not be
used to represent two different failure modes) across a manufacturer’s
entire product line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.4.4</dt>
<dd>A fault code (pending and/or confirmed, as required in sections (d) (e),
and (f)) shall be stored and available to an SAE J1978 scan tool within 10
seconds after a diagnostic has determined that a malfunction has
occurred.  A permanent fault code shall be stored and available to an SAE
J1978 scan tool no later than the end of an ignition cycle (including
electronic control unit shutdown) in which the corresponding confirmed
fault code causing the MIL to be illuminated has been stored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.4.5</dt>
<dd>Pending fault codes:
<ol type=A>
<li>On all 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles, pending fault codes for
all components and systems (including continuously and non-continuously
monitored components) shall be made available through the diagnostic
connector in accordance with SAE J1979 specifications (e.g.,
Mode/Service $07).</li>
</ol>
<ol type=A start=2>
<li>On all 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles, a pending fault code(s)
shall be stored and available through the diagnostic connector for all
currently malfunctioning monitored component(s) or system(s), regardless
of the MIL illumination status or confirmed fault code status (e.g., even
after a pending fault has matured to a confirmed fault code and the MIL is
illuminated, a pending fault code sh all be stored and available if the most
recent monitoring event indicates the component is malfunctioning).</li>
</ol>
<ol type=A start=3>
<li> Manufacturers using alternate statistical protocols for MIL illumination as
allowed in section (d)(2.2.6) shall submit to the Executive Officer a
protocol for setting pending fault codes. The Executive Officer shall
approve the proposed protocol upon determining that, overall, it is
equivalent to the requirements in sections (g)(4.4.5)(A) and (B) and that it
effectively provides service technicians with a quick and accurate
indication of a pending failure.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>4.4.5</dt>
<dd>Permanent fault codes:
<ol type=A>
<li>Permanent fault codes for all components and systems shall be made
available through the diagnostic connector in a standardized format that
distinguishes permanent fault codes from both pending fault codes and
confirmed fault codes.</li>
<li>A confirmed fault code shall be stored as a permanent fault code no later
than the end of the ignition cycle and subsequently at all times that the
confirmed fault code is commanding the MIL on (e.g., for currently failing
systems but not during the 40 warm-up cycle self-healing process
described in section (d)(2.4)).</li>
<li>Permanent fault codes shall be stored in NVRAM and may not be
erasable by any scan tool command (generic or enhanced) or by
disconnecting power to the on-board computer.</li>
<li>Permanent fault codes may not be erased when the control module
containing the permanent fault codes is reprogrammed unless the
readiness status (refer to section (g)(4.1)) for all monitored components
and systems is set to “not complete” in conjunction with the
reprogramming event.</li>
<li>The OBD system shall have the ability to store a minimum of four current
confirmed fault codes as permanent fault codes in NVRAM. If the number
of confirmed fault codes currently commanding the MIL on exceeds the
maximum number of permanent fault codes that can be stored, the OBD
system shall store the earliest detected confirmed fault codes as
permanent fault codes. If additional confirmed fault codes are stored
when the maximum number of permanent fault codes is already stored in
NVRAM, the OBD system may not replace any existing permanent fault
code with the additional confirmed fault codes.</li>
