<dd>“Freeze frame” information required to be stored pursuant to sections
(d)(2.2.4), (e)(3.4.3), and (e)(6.4.4) shall be made available on demand
through the standardized data link connector in accordance with SAE J1979
specifications.</dd>

<dd>“Freeze frame” conditions must include the fault code which caused the data
to be stored and all of the signals required in section (f)(4.2.1) except number
of stored confirmed fault codes and MIL status.  Freeze frame conditions
shall also include all of the signals required on the vehicle in sections
(f)(4.2.2) through (4.2.4) that are used for diagnostic or control purposes in
the specific diagnostic or emission-critical powertrain control unit that stored
the fault code except: oxygen sensor output, air/fuel ratio sensor output,
catalyst temperature, evaporative system vapor pressure, monitor status
since last engine shut off, distance traveled while MIL activated, distance
traveled since fault memory last cleared, and number of warm-up cycles
since fault memory last cleared.</dd>
