(5.6.1)  Definition:
(A)  The general denominator is defined as a measure of the number of times a
vehicle has been operated as defined in section (d)(5.6.2)(B).
(B)  The general denominator shall be reported in accordance with the
specifications in section (f)(5.2.1).
(5.6.2)  Specifications for incrementing:
(A)  The general denominator, when incremented, shall be incremented by an
integer of one. The general denominator may not be incremented more than
once per driving cycle.
(B)  The general denominator shall be incremented within ten seconds if and only
if the criteria identified in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) are satisfied on a single
driving cycle.
16
(C)  The OBDII system shall disable further incrementing of the general
denominator within ten seconds if a malfunction of any component used to
determine if the criteria in section (d)(4.3.2)(B) are satisfied (i.e., vehicle
speed, ambient temperature, elevation, idle operation, or time of operation)
has been detected and the corresponding pending fault code has been
stored. The general denominator may not be disabled from incrementing for
any other condition (e.g., the disablement criteria in sections (d)(4.5.1) and
(d)(4.5.2) may not disable the general denominator). Incrementing of the
general denominator shall resume within ten seconds when the malfunction is
no longer present (e.g., pending code erased through self-clearing or by a
scan tool command).
