(5.5.1)  Definition:
(A)   The ignition cycle counter is defined as a counter that indicates the number
of ignition cycles a vehicle has experienced as defined in section
(d)(5.5.2)(B).
(B)  The ignition cycle counter shall be reported in accordance with the
specifications in section (f)(5.2.1).
(5.5.2)  Specifications for incrementing:
(A)  The ignition cycle counter, when incremented, shall be incremented by an
integer of one. The ignition cycle counter may not be incremented more than
once per driving cycle.
(B)  The ignition cycle counter shall be incremented within ten seconds if and only
if the vehicle meets the engine start definition (see section (c)) for at least
two seconds plus or minus one second.
(C)  The OBDII system shall disable further incrementing of the ignition cycle
counter within ten seconds if a malfunction of any component used to
determine if the criteria in section (d)(5.5.2)(B) are satisfied (i.e., engine
speed or time of operation) has been detected and the corresponding
pending fault code has been stored. The ignition cycle counter may not be
disabled from incrementing for any other condition. Incrementing of the
ignition cycle counter shall resume within ten seconds when the malfunction
is no longer present (e.g., pending code erased through self-clearing or by a
scan tool command).
