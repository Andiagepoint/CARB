<dd>Definition:
<ol type=A>
<li>The ignition cycle counter is defined as a counter that indicates the
number of ignition cycles a vehicle has experienced as defined in
section(s) (d)(5.5.2)(B) and (C).</li>
<li>Except as required in section (d)(5.5.1)(C) below, the OBD II system shall
report one ignition cycle counter (as defined in section (d)(5.5.2)(B)).</li>
<li>For 2014 and subsequent model year plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, the
OBD II system shall report two ignition cycle counters (as defined in
sections (d)(5.5.2)(B) and (C)).</li>
<li>The ignition cycle counter shall be reported in accordance with the
specifications in section (g)(5.2.1).</li>
</ol>

<dt>5.5.2</dt>
<dd>Specifications for incrementing:
<ol type=A>
<li>The ignition cycle counter(s), when incremented, shall be incremented by
an integer of one. The ignition cycle counter(s) may not be incremented
more than once per driving cycle.</li>
<li>The ignition cycle counter shall be incremented within ten seconds if and
only if the following criteria are met:
(i) Except as required in section (d)(5.5.2)(B)(ii) below, the vehicle meets
the engine start definition (see section (c)) for at least two seconds
plus or minus one second.
(ii) For hybrid vehicles, the vehicle meets the propulsion system active
definition (see section (c)) for at least two seconds plus or minus one
second.</li>
<li>In addition to the counter described in section (d)(5.5.2)(B) above, 2014
and subsequent model year plug-in hybrid electric vehicles shall track and
report a second ignition cycle counter that shall be incremented within ten
seconds if and only if the vehicle has met the fueled engine operation
definition (see section (c)) for at least two seconds plus or minus one
second.</li>
<li>The OBD II system shall disable further incrementing of the ignition cycle
counter(s) within ten seconds if a malfunction of any component used to
determine if the criteria in section (d)(5.5.2)(B) and (C) are satisfied (e.g.,
engine speed or time of operation) has been detected and the
corresponding pending fault code has been stored. The ignition cycle
counter(s) may not be disabled from incrementing for any other condition.
Incrementing of the ignition cycle counter(s) shall resume within ten
seconds when the malfunction is no longer present (e.g., pending code
erased through self-clearing or by a scan tool command).</li>
