<dd>For each monitor required in section (e) to separately report an in-use
performance ratio, manufacturers shall implement software algorithms to
report a numerator and denominator in the standardized format specified
below and in accordance with the SAE J1979 specifications</dd>

<dt>5.2</dt>
<dd>Numerical Value Specifications:
<dl>
<dt>5.2.1</dt>
<dd>For the numerator, denominator, general denominator, and ignition cycle
counter:
<ol type=A>
<li>Each number shall have a minimum value of zero and a maximum value
of 65,535 with a resolution of one.</li>
<li>Each number shall be reset to zero only when a non-volatile memory
reset occurs (e.g., reprogramming event, etc.) or, if the numbers are
stored in keep-alive memory (KAM), when KAM is lost due to an
interruption in electrical power to the control module (e.g., battery
disconnect, etc.). Numbers may not be reset to zero under any other
circumstances including when a scan tool command to clear fault codes
or reset KAM is received.</li>
<li>If either the numerator or denominator for a specific component reaches
the maximum value of 65,535 &plusmn;2, both numbers shall be divided by two
before either is incremented again to avoid overflow problems.</li>
<li>If the ignition cycle counter reaches the maximum value of 65,535 &plusmn;2, the
ignition cycle counter shall rollover and increment to zero on the next
ignition cycle to avoid overflow problems.</li>
<li>If the general denominator reaches the maximum value of 65,535 &plusmn;2, the
general denominator shall rollover and increment to zero on the next
driving cycle that meets the general denominator definition to avoid
overflow problems.</li>
<li>If a vehicle is not equipped with a component (e.g., oxygen sensor bank
2, secondary air system), the corresponding numerator and denominator
for that specific component shall always be reported as zero.</li>
</ol>

<dt>5.2.2</dt>
<dd>For the ratio:
<ol type=A>
<li>The ratio shall have a minimum value of zero and a maximum value of
7.99527 with a resolution of 0.000122.</li>
<li>A ratio for a specific component shall be considered to be zero whenever
the corresponding numerator is equal to zero and the corresponding
denominator is not zero.</li>
<li>A ratio for a specific component shall be considered to be the maximum
value of 7.99527 if the corresponding denominator is zero or if the actual
value of the numerator divided by the denominator exceeds the maximum
value of 7.99527.</li>
