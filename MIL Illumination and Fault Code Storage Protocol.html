<dt>2.2.1</dt>
<dd>Upon detection of a malfunction, the OBD system shall store a pending
fault code within ten seconds indicating the likely area of the malfunction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.2.2</dt>
<dd>After storage of a pending fault code, if the identified malfunction is again
detected before the end of the next driving cycle in which monitoring
occurs, the MIL shall illuminate continuously and a confirmed fault code
shall be stored within 10 seconds. If a malfunction is not detected before
the end of the next driving cycle in which monitoring occurs (i.e., there is
no indication of the malfunction at any time during the driving cycle), the
corresponding pending fault code set according to section (d)(2.2.1) shall
be erased at the end of the driving cycle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.2.3</dt>
<dd>The OBD system shall illuminate the MIL and store a fault code within 10
seconds to inform the vehicle operator whenever the powertrain enters a
default or “limp home” mode of operation that can affect emissions or the
performance of the OBD II system or in the event of a malfunction of an
on-board computer(s) itself that can affect the performance of the OBD II
system.
<ol type=A>
<li>If the default or “limp home” mode of operation is recoverable (i.e.,  the
diagnostic or control strategy that caused the default or “limp home” mode
of operation can run on the next driving cycle and confirm the presence of
the condition that caused the default or “limp home” operation ), the OBD II
system may, in lieu of illuminating the MIL within 10 seconds on the first
driving cycle where the default or “limp home” mode of operation is
entered, delay illumination of the MIL until the condition causing the
default or “limp home” mode of operation is again detected before the end
of the next driving cycle.</li>
<li>MIL illumination and fault code storage is not required for engine
overtemperature default strategies that are only initiated after the
temperature gauge indicates a temperature in the red zone, or after an
overtemperature “hot” light is illuminated, or due to the verified occurrence
of severe operating conditions (e.g., extended trailer towing up a grade).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.2.4</dt>
<dd>For all 2010 and subsequent model year vehicles, the OBD II system shall
default to a MIL on state if the instrument panel receives and/or processes
instructions or commands from other diagnostic or e mission critical
electronic powertrain control units to illuminate the MIL and a malfunction
occurs (e.g., communication is lost) such that the instrument panel is no
longer able to properly receive the MIL illumination requests. Storage of a
fault code is not required for this malfunction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.2.5</dt>
<dd>For 50 percent of all 2010, 75 percent of all 2011, and 100 percent of all
2012 and subsequent model year vehicles (including 2012 model year
medium-duty vehicles with 2011 model year engines certified on an
engine dynamometer), before the end of an ignition cycle, the OBD II
system shall store confirmed fault codes that are currently causing the
MIL to be illuminated in NVRAM as permanent fault codes (as defined in
section (g)(4.4.6)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.2.6</dt>
<dd>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to employ
alternate statistical MIL illumination and fault code storage protocols to
those specified in these requirements. The Executive Officer shall grant
approval upon determining that the manufacturer has provided data
and/or engineering evaluation that demonstrate that the alternative
protocols can evaluate system performance and detect malfunctions in a
manner that is equally effective and timely. Except as otherwise provided
in section (e) for evaporative system malfunctions, s trategies requiring on
average more than six driving cycles for MIL illumination may not be
accepted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.2.6</dt>
<dd>
A manufacturer shall store and erase “freeze frame” conditions (as
defined in section (g)(4.3)) present at the time a malfunction is detected.
A manufacturer shall store and erase freeze frame conditions in
conjunction with storage and erasure of either pending or confirmed fault
codes as required elsewhere in section (d)(2.2).</dd>
