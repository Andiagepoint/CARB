<dt>2.1.1</dt>
<dd>The MIL shall be located on the driver's side instrument panel and be of
sufficient illumination and location to be readily visible under all lighting
conditions and shall be amber in color when illuminated. The MIL, when
illuminated, shall display the phrase “Check Engine” or “Service Engine
Soon”. The word “Powertrain” may be substituted for “Engine” in the
previous phrases. Alternatively, the International Standards Organization
(ISO) engine symbol may be substituted for the word “Engine” or for the
entire phrase.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.1.2</dt>
<dd>The MIL shall illuminate in the key on, engine off position before engine
cranking to indicate that the MIL is functional. For all 2005 and
subsequent model year vehicles, the MIL shall continuously illuminate
during this functional check for a minimum of 15-20 seconds. During this
functional check of the MIL, the data stream value for MIL status shall
indicate commanded off (see section (g)(4.2)) unless the MIL has also
been commanded on for a detected malfunction. This functional check of
the MIL is not required during vehicle operation in the key on, engine off
position subsequent to the initial engine cranking of each driving cycle
(e.g., due to an engine stall or other non-commanded engine shutoff).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.1.3</dt>
<dd>At the manufacturer's option, the MIL may be used to indicate readiness
status in a standardized format (see section (g)(4.1.3)) in the key on,
engine off position.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.1.4</dt>
<dd>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to also use the
MIL to indicate which, if any, fault codes are currently stored (e.g., to
“blink” the stored codes). The Executive Officer shall approve the request
upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated that the
method used to indicate the fault codes will not be activated during a
California Inspection and Maintenance test or during routine driver
operation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2.1.5</dt>
<dd>The MIL may not be used for any purpose other than specified in this
regulation.</dd>
