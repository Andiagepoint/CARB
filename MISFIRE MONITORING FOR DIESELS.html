(3.5.1)  Requirement:
(A)  The OBDII system on a diesel engine shall be capable of detecting misfire
occurring continuously in one or more cylinders. To the extent possible
without adding hardware for this specific purpose, the OBDII system shall
also identify the specific continuously misfiring cylinder.
(B)   If more than one cylinder is continuously misfiring, a separate fault code shall
be stored indicating that multiple cylinders are misfiring. When identifying
multiple cylinder misfire, the manufacturer is not required to also identify each
of the continuously misfiring cylinders individually through separate fault
codes.
(3.5.2) Malfunction Criteria: The OBDII system shall detect a misfire malfunction
when one or more cylinders are continuously misfiring.
(3.5.3) Monitoring Conditions: The OBDII system shall monitor for misfire during
engine idle conditions at least once per driving cycle in which the monitoring
conditions for misfire are met. A manufacturer shall submit monitoring
conditions to the Executive Officer for approval.  The Executive Officer shall
approve manufacturer defined monitoring conditions that are determined
(based on manufacturer submitted data and/or other engineering
documentation) to: (i ) be technically necessary to ensure robust detection of
29
malfunctions (e.g., avoid false passes and false detection of malfunctions),
(ii) require no more than 1000 cumulative engine revolutions, and (iii) do not
require any single continuous idle operation of more than 15 seconds to
make a determination that a malfunction is present (e.g., a decision can be
made with data gathered during several idle operations of 15 seconds or
less). For 2004 model year vehicles only, a manufacturer may comply with
the monitoring conditions for diesel misfire monitoring in title 13, CCR
section 1968.1 in lieu of meeting the monitoring conditions in section
(e)(3.5.3).
(3.5.4) MIL Illumination and Fault Code Storage: General requirements for MIL
illumination and fault code storage are set forth in section (d)(2).
