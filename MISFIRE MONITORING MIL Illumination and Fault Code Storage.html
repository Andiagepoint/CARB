(3.4.1) Misfire causing catalyst damage. Upon detection of the level of misfire specified
in section (e)(3.2.1) above, the following criteria shall apply for MIL illumination
and fault code storage:
(A)  Pending fault codes
(i)  A pending fault code shall be stored immediately if, during a single driving
cycle, the specified misfire level is exceeded three times when operating
26
in the positive torque region encountered during an FTP cycle or is
exceeded on a single occasion when operating at any other engine
speed and load condition in the positive torque region defined in section
(e)(3.3.1).
(ii)  Immediately after a pending fault code is stored as specified in section
(e)(3.4.1)(A)(i) above, the MIL shall blink once per second at all times
while misfire is occurring during the driving cycle.
a.  The MIL may be extinguished during those times when misfire is not
occurring during the driving cycle.
b. If, at the time a misfire malfunction occurs, the MIL is already
illuminated for a malfunction other than misfire, the MIL shall blink as
previously specified in section (e)(3.4.1)(A)(ii) while misfire is
occurring. If misfiring ceases, the MIL shall stop blinking but remain
illuminated as required by the other malfunction.
(B)  Confirmed fault codes
(i)  If a pending fault code for exceeding the misfire level set forth in section
(e)(3.2.1) is stored, the OBDII system shall immediately store a
confirmed fault code if the percentage of misfire specified in section
(e)(3.2.1) is again exceeded one or more times during either: (a) the
driving cycle immediately following the storage of the pending fault code,
regardless of the conditions encountered during the driving cycle; or (b)
on the next driving cycle in which similar conditions (see section (c)) to
the engine conditions that occurred when the pending fault code was
stored are encountered.
(ii)  If a pending fault code for exceeding the misfire level set forth in section
(e)(3.2.2) is stored from a previous drive cycle, the OBDII system shall
immediately store a confirmed fault code if the percentage of misfire
specified in section (e)(3.2.1) is exceeded one or more times regardless
of the conditions encountered.
(iii)  Upon storage of a confirmed fault code, the MIL shall blink as specified
in subparagraph (e)(3.4.1)(A)(ii) above as long as misfire is occurring
and the MIL shall remain continuously illuminated if the misfiring ceases.
(C)  Erasure of pending fault codes
Pending fault codes shall be erased at the end of the next driving cycle in
which similar conditions to the engine conditions that occurred when the
pending fault code was stored have been encountered without any
exceedance of the specified misfire levels. The pending code may also be
erased if similar driving conditions are not encountered during the next 80
driving cycles subsequent to the initial detection of a malfunction.
(D)   Exemptions for vehicles with fuel shutoff and default fuel control.
Notwithstanding sections (e)(3.4.1)(A) and (B) above, in vehicles that provide
for fuel shutoff and default fuel control to prevent over fueling during catalyst
damage misfire conditions, the MIL need not blink. Instead, the MIL may
illuminate  continuously in accordance with the requirements for continuous
MIL illumination in sections (e)(3.4.1)(B)(iii) above upon detection of misfire,
provided that the fuel shutoff and default control are activated as soon as
27
misfire is detected. Fuel shutoff and default fuel control may be deactivated
only to permit fueling outside of the misfire range. Manufacturers may also
periodically, but not more than once every 30 seconds, deactivate fuel shutoff
and default fuel control to determine if the specified catalyst damage misfire
level is still being exceeded. Normal fueling and fuel control may be resumed
if the specified catalyst damage misfire level is no longer being exceeded.
(E)   Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval of strategies that
continuously illuminate the MIL in lieu of blinking the MIL during extreme
catalyst damage misfire conditions (i.e., catalyst damage misfire occurring at
all engine speeds and loads).  Executive Officer approval shall be granted
upon determining that the manufacturer employs the strategy only when
catalyst damage misfire levels cannot be avoided during reasonable driving
conditions and the manufacturer has demonstrated that the strategy will
encourage operation of the vehicle in conditions that will minimize catalyst
damage (e.g., at low engine speeds and loads).
(3.4.2) Misfire causing emissions to exceed 1.5 times the FTP standards. Upon
detection of the misfire level specified in section (e)(3.2.2), the following
criteria shall apply for MIL illumination and fault code storage:
(A)   Misfire within the first 1000 revolutions after engine start.
(i)   A pending fault code shall be stored no later than after the first
exceedance of the specified misfire level during a single driving cycle if
the  exceedance occurs within the first 1000 revolutions after engine start
(defined in section (c)) during which misfire detection is active.
(ii)  If a pending fault code is stored, the OBDII system shall illuminate the MIL
and store a confirmed fault code within ten seconds if an exceedanceof
the specified misfire level is again detected in the first 1000 revolutions
during any subsequent driving cycle, regardless of the conditions
encountered during the driving cycle.
(iii)  The pending fault code shall be erased at the end of the next driving
cycle in which similar conditions to the engine conditions that occurred
when the pending fault code was stored have been encountered without
an exceedance of the specified percentage of misfire. The pending code
may also be erased if similar conditions are not encountered during the
next 80 driving cycles immediately following the initial detection of the
malfunction.
(B)   Exceedances after the first 1000 revolutions after engine start.
(i)  A pending fault code shall be stored no later than after the fourth
exceedance of the percentage of misfire specified in section (e)(3.2.2)
during a single driving cycle.
(ii)  If a pending fault code is stored, the OBDII system shall illuminate the MIL
and store a confirmed fault code within ten seconds if the percentage of
misfire specified in section (e)(3.2.2) is again exceeded four times
during: (a) the driving cycle immediately following the storage of the
pending fault code, regardless of the conditions encountered during the
driving cycle; or (b) on the next driving cycle in which similar conditions
28
(see section (c)) to the engine conditions that occurred when the pending
fault code was stored are encountered.
(iii)  The pending fault code may be erased at the end of the next driving cycle
in which similar conditions to the engine conditions that occurred when
the pending fault code was stored have been encountered without an
exceedance of the specified percentage of misfire. The pending code
may also be erased if similar conditions are not encountered during the
next 80 driving cycles immediately following initial detection of the
malfunction.
(3.4.3)  Storage of freeze frame conditions.
(A)  A manufacturer shall store and erase freeze frame conditions either in
conjunction with storing and erasing a pending fault code or in conjunction
with storing and erasing a confirmed fault code.
(B)   If freeze frame conditions are stored for a malfunction other than misfire or
fuel system malfunction (see section (e)(6)) when a fault code is stored as
specified in section (e)(3.4) above, the stored freeze frame information shall
be replaced with freeze frame information regarding the misfire malfunction.
(3.4.4)  Storage of misfire conditions for similar conditions determination. Upon
detection of misfire under sections (e)(3.4.1) or (3.4.2), manufacturers shall
store the following engine conditions: engine speed, load, and warm-up
status of the first misfire event that resulted in the storage of the pending fault
code.
(3.4.5)  Extinguishing the MIL. The MIL may be extinguished after three sequential
driving cycles in which similar conditions have been encountered without an
exceedance of the specified percentage of misfire.
