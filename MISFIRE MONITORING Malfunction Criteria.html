The OBDII system shall detect a misfire malfunction
pursuant to the following:
<dl>
<dt>3.2.1</dt>
<dd> Misfire causing catalyst damage:
<ol type=A>
<li>Manufacturers shall determine the percentage of misfire evaluated in 200
revolution increments for each engine speed and load condition that
would result in a temperature that causes catalyst damage.  The
manufacturer shall submit documentation to support this percentage of
misfire as required in section (i)(2.5). For every engine speed and load
condition that this percentage of misfire is determined to be lower than
five percent, the manufacturer may set the malfunction criteria at five
percent.</li>
<li>Subject to Executive Officer approval, a manufacturer may employ a
longer interval than 200 revolutions but  only for determining, on a given
driving cycle, the first misfire exceedance as provided in section
(e)(3.4.1)(A) below. Executive Officer approval shall be granted upon
determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or an
engineering evaluation that demonstrate that catalyst damage would not
occur due to unacceptably high catalyst temperatures before the interval
has elapsed.</li>
<li>A misfire malfunction shall be detected if the percentage of misfire
established in section (e)(3.2.1)(A) is exceeded.</li>
<li>For purposes of establishing the temperature at which catalyst damage
occurs as required in section (e)(3.2.1)(A), on 2005 and subsequent
model year vehicles, manufacturers may not define catalyst damage at a
temperature more severe than what the catalyst system could be
operated at for ten consecutive hours and still meet the applicable FTP
full useful life standards.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>3.2.2</dt>
<dd>Misfire causing emissions to exceed 1.5 times the FTP standards:
<ol type=A>
<li>Manufacturers shall determine the percentage of misfire evaluated in
1000 revolution increments that would cause emissions from an emission
durability demonstration vehicle to exceed 1.5 times any of the applicable
FTP standards if the percentage of misfire were present from the
beginning of the test. To establish this percentage of misfire, the
manufacturer shall utilize misfire events occurring at equally spaced,
complete engine cycle intervals, across randomly selected cylinders
throughout each 1000-revolution increment. If this percentage of misfire
is determined to be lower than one percent, the manufacturer may set the
malfunction criteria at one percent.</li>
<li>Subject to Executive Officer approval, a manufacturer may employ other
revolution increments. The Executive Officer shall grant approval upon
determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated that the strategy
would be equally effective and timely in detecting misfire.</li>
<li>A malfunction shall be detected if the percentage of misfire established in
section (3.2.2)(A) is exceeded regardless of the pattern of misfire events
(e.g., random, equally spaced, continuous, etc.).</li>
