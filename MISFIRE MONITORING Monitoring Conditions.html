<dt>3.3.1</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall continuously monitor for misfire under the following
conditions:
<ol type=A>
<li>Except as provided in section (e)(3.3.6) below, from no later than the end
of the second crankshaft revolution after engine start,</li>
<li>While under positive torque conditions during the rise time and settling
time for engine speed to reach the desired idle engine speed at engine
start-up (i.e., “flare-up” and “flare-down”), and</li>
<li>Under all positive torque engine speeds and load conditions except within
the following range: the engine operating region bound by the positive
torque line (i.e., engine load with the transmission in neutral), and the two
following engine operating points: an engine speed of 3000 rpm wit h the
engine load at the positive torque line, and the redline engine speed
(defined in section (c)) with the engine's manifold vacuum at four inches of
mercury lower than that at the positive torque line.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>3.3.2</dt>
<dd>If a monitoring system cannot detect all misfire p atterns under all required
engine speed and load conditions as required in section (e)(3.3.1) above,
the manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to accept the
monitoring system. In evaluating the manufacturer’s request, the
Executive Officer shall consider the following factors: the magnitude of the
region(s) in which misfire detection is limited, the degree to which misfire
detection is limited in the region(s) (i.e., the probability of detection of
misfire events), the frequency with which said region(s) are expected to be
encountered in-use, the type of misfire patterns for which misfire detection
is troublesome, and demonstration that the monitoring technology
employed is not inherently incapable of detecting misfire under required
conditions (i.e., compliance can be achieved on other engines). The
evaluation shall be based on the following misfire patterns: equally spaced
misfire occurring on randomly selected cylinders, single cylinder
continuous misfire, and paired cylinder (cylinders firing at the same crank
angle) continuous misfire.</dd>
<dt>3.3.3</dt>
<dd>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval of a monitoring
system that has reduced misfire detection capability during the portion of
the first 1000 revolutions after engine start that a cold start emission
reduction strategy that reduces engine torque (e.g., spark retard
strategies) is active. The Executive Officer shall approve the request
upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated that the
probability of detection is greater than or equal to 75 percent during the
worst case condition (i.e., lowest generated torque) for a vehicle operated
continuously at idle (park/neutral idle) on a cold start between 50-86
degrees Fahrenheit and that the technology cannot reliably detect a
higher percentage of the misfire events during the conditions.</dd>
<dt>3.3.4</dt>
<dd>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable misfire
monitoring or employ an alternate malfunction criterion when misfire
cannot be distinguished from other effects.
<ol type=A>
<li>Upon determining that the manufacturer has presented documentation
that demonstrates the disablement interval or period of use of an alternate
malfunction criterion is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false
detection, the Executive Officer shall approve the disablement or use of
the alternate malfunction criterion for conditions involving:
(i) rough road,
(ii) fuel cut,
(iii) gear changes for manual transmission vehicles,
(iv) traction control or other vehicle stability control activation such as anti lock braking or other engine torque modifications to enhance vehicle
stability,
(v) off-board control or intrusive activation of vehicle components or
diagnostics during service or assembly plant testing,
(vi) portions of intrusive evaporative system or EGR diagnostics that can
significantly affect engine stability (i.e., while the purge valve is open
during the vacuum pull-down of a evaporative system leak check but
not while the purge valve is closed and the evaporative system is
sealed or while an EGR diagnostic causes the EGR valve to be
intrusively cycled on and off during positive torque conditions), or
(vii) engine speed, load, or torque transients due to throttle movements
more rapid than occurs over the US06 cycle for the worst case vehicle
within each test group.</li>
<li>Additionally, the Executive Officer will approve a manufacturer's request
in accordance with sections (e)(17.3), (17.4), and (17.6) to disable misfire
monitoring when fuel level is 15 percent or less of the nominal capacity of
the fuel tank, when PTO units are active, or while engine  coolant
temperature is below 20 degrees Fahrenheit. The Executive Officer will
approve a request to continue disablement on engine starts when engine
coolant temperature is below 20 degrees Fahrenheit at engine start until
engine coolant temperature exceeds 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>In general, for 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles, the Executive
Officer shall not approve disablement for conditions involving normal air
conditioning compressor cycling from on-to-off or off-to-on, automatic
transmission gear shifts (except for shifts occurring during wide open
throttle operation), transitions from idle to off -idle, normal engine speed or
load changes that occur during the engine speed rise time and settling
time (i.e., “flare-up” and “flare-down”) immediately after engine starting
without any vehicle operator-induced actions (e.g., throttle stabs), or
excess acceleration (except for acceleration rates that exceed the
maximum acceleration rate obtainable at wide open throttle while the
vehicle is in gear due to abnormal conditions such as slipping of a clutch).</li>
<li>The Executive Officer may approve misfire monitoring disablement or use
of an alternate malfunction criterion for any other condition on a case by
case basis upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated that
the request is based on an unusual or unforeseen circumstance and that
it is applying the best available computer and monitoring technology.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>3.3.5</dt>
<dd>For engines with more than eight cylinders that cannot meet the
requirements of section (e)(3.3.1), a manufacturer may request Executive
Officer approval to use alternative misfire monitoring conditions. The
Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the
manufacturer has submitted data and/or an engineering evaluation which
demonstrate that misfire detection throughout the required operating
region cannot be achieved when employing proven monitoring technology
(i.e., a technology that provides for compliance with these requirements
on other engines) and provided misfire is detected to the fullest extent
permitted by the technology. However, the Executive Officer may not
grant the request if the misfire detection system is unable to monitor
during all positive torque operating conditions encountered during an FTP
cycle.</dd>
<dt>3.3.6</dt>
<dd>For engines that employ engine shutoff strategies that do not require the
vehicle operator to restart the engine to continue driving (e.g., hybrid
vehicle with engine shutoff at idle), a manufacturer shall request Executive
Officer approval of the monitoring conditions under which misfire
monitoring occurs after engine fueling begins for the initial start and after
each time fueling resumes. Executive Officer approval of the monitoring
conditions shall be based on the equivalence of the conditions to those
specified in section (e)(3.3.1)(A) above.</dd>
