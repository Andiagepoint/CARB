(3.3.1) Manufacturers shall continuously monitor for misfire under the following
conditions:
(A)  From no later than the end of the second crankshaft revolution after engine
start,
(B)  During the rise time and settling time for engine speed to reach the desired
idle engine speed at engine start-up (i.e., “flare-up” and “flare-down”), and
(C)  Under all positive torque engine speeds and load conditions except within
the following range: the engine operating region bound by the positive torque
line (i.e., engine load with the transmission in neutral), and the two following
engine operating points: an engine speed of 3000 rpm with the engine load
at the positive torque line, and the redline engine speed (defined in section
(c)) with the engine's manifold vacuum at four inches of mercury lower than
that at the positive torque line.
(3.3.2) If a monitoring system cannot detect all misfire patterns under all required
engine speed and load conditions as required in section (e)(3.3.1) above,
the manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to accept the
24
monitoring system.  In evaluating the manufacturer’s request, the Executive
Officer shall consider the following factors: the magnitude of the region(s) in
which misfire detection is limited, the degree to which misfire detection is
limited in the region(s) (i.e., the probability of detection of misfire events), the
frequency with which said region(s) are expected to be encountered in-use,
the type of misfire patterns for which misfire detection is troublesome, and
demonstration that the monitoring technology employed is not inherently
incapable of detecting misfire under required conditions (i.e., compliance
can be achieved on other engines). The evaluation shall be based on the
following misfire patterns: equally spaced misfire occurring on randomly
selected cylinders, single cylinder continuous misfire, and paired cylinder
(cylinders firing at the same crank angle) continuous misfire.
(3.3.3) A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval of a monitoring
system that has reduced misfire detection capability during the portion of the
first 1000 revolutions after engine start that a cold start emission reduction
strategy that reduces engine torque (e.g., spark retard strategies) is active.
The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the
manufacturer has demonstrated that the probability of detection is greater
than or equal to 75 percent during the worst case condition (i.e., lowest
generated torque) for a vehicle operated continuously at idle (park/neutral
idle) on a cold start between 50-86 degrees Fahrenheit and that the
technology cannot reliably detect a higher percentage of the misfire events
during the conditions.
(3.3.4) A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable misfire
monitoring or employ an alternate malfunction criterion when misfire cannot
be distinguished from other effects.
(A)   Upon determining that the manufacturer has presented documentation that
demonstrates the disablement interval or period of use of an alternate
malfunction criterion is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false
detection, the Executive Officer shall approve the disablement or use of the
alternate malfunction criterion for conditions involving:
(i)   rough road,
(ii)   fuel cut,
(iii)   gear changes for manual transmission vehicles,
(iv)  traction control or other vehicle stability control activation such as antilock braking or other engine torque modifications to enhance vehicle
stability,
(v)  off-board control or intrusive activation of vehicle components or
diagnostics during service or assembly plant testing,
(vi)  portions of intrusive evaporative system or EGR diagnostics that can
significantly affect engine stability (i.e., while the purge valve is open
during the vacuum pull-down of a evaporative system leak check but not
while the purge valve is closed and the evaporative system is sealed or
while an EGR diagnostic causes the EGR valve to be intrusively cycled
on and off during positive torque conditions), or
25
(vii)  engine speed, load, or torque transients due to throttle movements more
rapid than occurs over the US06 cycle for the worst case vehicle within
each test group.
(B)  Additionally, the Executive Officer will approve a manufacturer's request in
accordance with sections (e)(18.3) through (18.5) to disable misfire
monitoring when fuel level is 15 percent or less of the nominal capacity of the
fuel tank, when PTO units are active, or while engine coolant temperature is
below 20 degrees Fahrenheit. The Executive Officer will approve a request
to continue disablement on engine starts when engine coolant temperature is
below 20 degrees Fahrenheit at engine start until engine coolant
temperature exceeds 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
(C)  In general, for 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles, the Executive
Officer shall not approve disablement for conditions involving normal air
conditioning compressor cycling from on-to-off or off-to-on, automatic
transmission gear shifts (except for shifts occurring during wide open throttle
operation), transitions from idle to off-idle, normal engine speed or load
changes that occur during the engine speed rise time and settling time (i.e.,
“flare-up” and “flare-down”) immediately after engine starting without any
vehicle operator-induced actions (e.g., throttle stabs), or excess acceleration
(except for acceleration rates that exceed the maximum acceleration rate
obtainable at wide open throttle while the vehicle is in gear due to abnormal
conditions such as slipping of a clutch).
(D)   The Executive Officer may approve misfire monitoring disablement or use of
an alternate malfunction criterion for any other condition on a case by case
basis upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated that the
request is based on an unusual or unforeseen circumstance and that it is
applying the best available computer and monitoring technology.
(3.3.5) For engines with more than eight cylinders that cannot meet the requirements
of section (e)(3.3.1), a manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval
to use alternative misfire monitoring conditions.  The Executive Officer shall
approve the request upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted
data and/or an engineering evaluation which demonstrate that misfire
detection throughout the required operating region cannot be achieved when
employing proven monitoring technology (i.e., a technology that provides for
compliance with these requirements on other engines) and provided misfire
is detected to the fullest extent permitted by the technology. However, the
Executive Officer may not grant the request if the misfire detection system is
unable to monitor during all positive torque operating conditions encountered
during an FTP cycle.
