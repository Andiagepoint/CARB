(3.1.1) The OBDII system shall monitor the engine for misfire causing catalyst
damage and misfire causing excess emissions.
(3.1.2) The OBDII s ystem shall identify the specific cylinder that is experiencing
misfire. Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to store a
general misfire fault code instead of a cylinder specific fault code under
certain operating conditions. The Executive Officer shall approve the request
upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or an
engineering evaluation that demonstrate that the misfiring cylinder cannot be
reliably identified when the conditions occur.
(3.1.3) If more than one cylinder is misfiring, a separate fault code shall be stored
indicating that multiple cylinders are misfiring except as allowed below.
When identifying multiple cylinder misfire, the manufacturer is not required to
also identify each of the misfiring cylinders individually through separate fault
codes. For 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles, if more than 90
percent of the detected misfires occur in a single cylinder, the manufacturer
may elect to store the appropriate fault code indicating the specific misfiring
cylinder in lieu of the multiple cylinder misfire fault code. If, however, two or
more cylinders individually have more than 10 percent of the total number of
detected misfires, a multiple cylinder fault code must be stored.
