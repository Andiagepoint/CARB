<dt>6.1</dt>
<dd>For 2010 and subsequent model year medium-duty vehicles certified to an
engine dynamometer exhaust emission standard, in determining the
malfunction criteria for diesel engine monitors in section (f) that are required
to indicate a malfunction before emissions exceed an emission threshold
based on the applicable standard, the manufacturer shall:
<dl>
<dt>6.1.1</dt>
<dd>Use the emission test cycle and standard (i.e., FTP or SET) determined
by the manufacturer, through use of data and/or engineering analysis, to
be more stringent (i.e., to result in higher emissions with the same level of
monitored component malfunction) as the “applicable standard”.</dd>
<dt>6.1.2</dt>
<dd>Identify in the certification documentation required under section (i) the
test cycle and standard determined by the manufacturer to be mo re
stringent for each applicable monitor.</dd>
<dt>6.1.3</dt>
<dd>If the Executive Officer reasonably believes tha t a manufacturer has
incorrectly determined the test cycle and standard that is  more stringent,
the Executive Officer shall require the manufacturer to provide emission
data and/or engineering analysis showing that the other test cycle and
standard are less stringent.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>6.2</dt>
<dd>For 2007 and subsequent model year light-duty and medium-duty vehicles
equipped with emission controls that experience infrequent regeneration
events (e.g., active PM filter regeneration, NOx adsorber desulfation), a
manufacturer shall adjust the emission test results that are used to determine
the malfunction criterion for monitors that are required to indicate a
malfunction before emissions exceed a certain emission threshold.  Except
as provided in section (d)(6.2.7), for each monitor on medium-duty vehicles
using engines certified on an engine dynamometer, the manufacturer shall
adjust the emission result using the procedure described in CFR title 40, part
86.004-28(i) with the component for which the malfunction criteria is being
established deteriorated to the malfunction threshold.  For light-duty and
medium-duty vehicles certified on a chassis dynamometer, the manufacturer
shall submit a plan for Executive Officer approval to adjust the emission
results using an approach similar to the procedure described in CFR title 40,
part 86.004-28(i). Executive Officer approval shall be based on the
effectiveness of the proposed plan to quantify the emission impact and
frequency of regeneration events.  The adjusted emission value shall be used
for purposes of determining whether or not the specified emission threshold
is exceeded (e.g., a malfunction must be detected before the adjusted
emission value exceeds 1.5 times any applicable standard).
<dl>
<dt>6.2.1</dt>
<dd>For purposes of section (d)(6.2), “regeneration” means an event during
which emission levels change while the emission control performance is
being restored by design.</dd>
<dt>6.2.2</dt>
<dd>For purposes of section (d)(6.2), “infrequent” means having an expected
frequency of less than once per FTP cycle.</dd>
<dt>6.2.3</dt>
<dd>Except as specified in section (d)(6.2.4) for NMHC catalyst monitoring, for
2007 through 2009 model year vehicles, in lieu of establishing the
adjustment factor for each monitor with the component for which the
malfunction criteria is being established deteriorated to the malfunction
threshold as required in section (d)(6.2), the manufacturer may use the
adjustment factor established for certification (e.g., without components
deteriorated to the malfunction threshold).</dd>
<dt>6.2.4</dt>
<dd>For NMHC catalyst monitoring (section (f)(1)) on 2008 and subsequent
model year vehicles, a manufacturer shall establish the adjustment factor
for the NMHC catalyst monitor with the NMHC catalyst deteriorated to the
malfunction threshold as required in section (d)(6.2).  In lieu of
establishing this adjustment factor for 2008 and 2009 model year vehicles,
a manufacturer may provide emission data demonstrating that the worst
case emission levels from a deteriorated NMHC catalyst are below the
malfunction threshold specified in section (f)(1.2.2). The demonstration
shall include emission testing with a NMHC catalyst deteriorated to the
malfunction threshold or worse and with both the infrequent regeneration
event occurring and without it occurring. The manufacturer shall calculate
the worst case emission level by applying the frequency factor (“F” as
calculated according to CFR, title 40, part 86.004-28(i)) of the infrequent
regeneration event used for tailpipe certification to the measured
emissions with the infrequent regeneration event occurring and adding
that result to the measured emissions without the infrequent regeneration
event occurring. This calculated final sum shall be used as the adjusted
emission level and compared to the malfunction threshold for purposes of
determining compliance with the monitoring requirements. The
manufacturer shall submit a test plan for Executive Officer approval
describing the emission testing procedure and how the worst case
components will be established. The Executive Officer shall approve it
upon finding the test procedure and components used will likely generate
a worst case emission level.</dd>
<dt>6.2.5</dt>
<dd>For purposes of determining the adjustment factors for each monitor, the
manufacturer shall submit engineering data, analysis, and/or emission
data to the Executive Officer for approval. The Executive Officer shall
approve the factors upon finding the submitted information supports the
adjustment factors.</dd>
<dt>6.2.6</dt>
<dd>For purposes of enforcement testing in accordance with section (d)(7) and
title 13, CCR section 1968.5, the adjustment factors establishe d for each
monitor by the manufacturer according to section (d)(6.2) shall be used
when determining compliance with emission thresholds.</dd>
<dt>6.2.7</dt>
<dd>In lieu of using the procedure described in CFR title 40, part 86.004-28(i),
the manufacturer may submit an alternate p lan to calculate the
adjustment factors for determining the adjusted emission values to the
Executive Officer for review and approval. Executive Officer approval of
the plan shall be conditioned upon the manufacturer providing data and/or
engineering evaluation demonstrating the procedure is consistent with
good engineering judgment in determining appropriate modifications to
the tailpipe certification adjustment factors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>6.3</dt>
<dd>For every 2007 through 2012 model year light-duty vehicle test group certified
to the higher allowable emission thresholds specified in section (f) (e.g., 5.0
or 3.0 times the applicable standards for NMHC converting catalyst
monitoring) for vehicles prior to the 2013 model year:
<dl>
<dt>6.3.1</dt>
<dd>The manufacturer shall conduct in-use enforcement testing for compliance
with the tailpipe emission standards in accordance with title 13, CCR
sections 2136 through 2140. Within six months after OBD II certification
of a test group, the manufacturer shall submit a plan for conducting the
testing to the Executive Officer for approval. The Executive Officer shall
approve the plan upon determining that the testing will be done in
accordance with the procedures used by ARB when conducting such
testing, that the plan will allow for a valid sample of at least 10 vehicles in
the mileage range of 30,000 to 40,000 miles for comparison to the FTP
intermediate (e.g., 50,000 mile) useful life standard and at least 10
vehicles in the mileage range of 90,000 to 100,000 miles for comparison
to the FTP full useful life standard, and that copies of all records and data
collected during the program will be provided to ARB.  Manufacturers may
also submit testing plans and supporting data for Executive Officer
approval that differ from compliance testing under title 13, CCR, sections
2136 through 2140.  The Executive Officer shall also approve the plans
upon determining that the plan provides equivalent assurance in verifying
vehicles are meeting the tailpipe emission standards within the useful life.
The Executive Officer may use the submitted data in lieu of or in addition
to data collected pursuant to title 13, CCR section 2139 for purposes of
the notification and use of test results described in title 13, CCR section
2140; and</dd>
<dt>6.3.2</dt>
<dd>The certification shall be conditioned upon the manufacturer agreeing
that, for any test group(s) determined to be noncompliant in accordance
with title 13, CCR section 2140 or title 13, CCR section 1968.5, the
Executive Officer shall determine the excess emissions caused by the
noncompliance and the manufacturer shall fund a program(s) that will
offset any such excess emissions.</dd>
