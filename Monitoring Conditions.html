Section (d)(3) sets forth the general monitoring requirements while sections (e)
and (f) set forth the specific monitoring requirements as well as identify which of
the following general monitoring requirements in section (d)(3) are applicable for
each monitored component or system identified in sections (e) and (f).
<dl>
<dt>3.1</dt>
<dd>For all 2004 and subsequent model year vehicles:
<dl>
<dt>3.1.1</dt>
<dd>As specifically provided for in sections (e) and (f), manufacturers shall
define monitoring conditions, subject to Executive Officer approval, for
detecting malfunctions identified in sections (e) and (f). The Executive
Officer shall approve manufacturer defined monitoring conditions that are
determined (based on manufacturer submitted data and/or other
engineering documentation) to be: technically necessary to ensure robust
detection of malfunctions (e.g., avoid false passes and false indications of
malfunctions), designed to ensure monitoring will occur under conditions
which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal urban
vehicle operation and use, and designed to ensure monitoring will occur
during the FTP cycle or Unified cycle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>3.1.2</dt>
<dd>Monitoring shall occur at least once per driving cycle in which the
monitoring conditions are met.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>3.1.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to define
monitoring conditions that are not encountered during the FTP cycle or
Unified cycle as required in section (d)(3.1.1). In evaluating the
manufacturer's request, the Executive Officer shall consider the degree to
which the requirement to run during the FTP or Unified cycle restricts inuse monitoring, the technical necessity for defining monitoring conditions
that are not encountered during the FTP or Unified cycle, data and/or an
engineering evaluation submitted by the manufacturer which demonstrate
that the component/system does not normally function, or monitoring is
otherwise not feasible, during the FTP or Unified cycle, and, where
applicable in section (d)(3.2), the ability of the manufacturer to
demonstrate the monitoring conditions will satisfy the minimum acceptable
in-use monitor performance ratio requirement as defined in section
(d)(3.2) (e.g., data which show in-use driving meets the minimum
requirements).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>3.2</dt>
<dd>As specifically provided for in sections (e) and (f), manufacturers shall define
monitoring conditions in accordance with the criteria in sections (d)(3.2.1)
through (3.2.3). The requirements of section (d)(3.2) shall be phased in as
follows: 30 percent of all 2005 model year vehicles, 60 percent of all 2006
model year vehicles, and 100 percent of all 2007 and subsequent model year
vehicles. Manufacturers may use an alternate phase-in schedule in lieu of
the required phase-in schedule if the alternate phase -in schedule provides for
equivalent compliance volume as defined in section (c) with the exception
that 100 percent of 2007 and subsequent model year vehicles shall comply
with the requirements. Small volume manufacturers shall meet the
requirements on 100 percent of 2007 and subsequent model year vehicles
but shall not be required to meet the specific phase-in requirements for the
2005 and 2006 model years.
<dl>
<dt>3.2.1</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall define monitoring conditions that, in addition to
meeting the criteria in section (d)(3.1), ensure that the monitor yields an
in-use performance ratio (as defined in section (d)(4)) that meets or
exceeds the minimum acceptable in-use monitor performance ratio on inuse vehicles. For purposes of this regulation, except as provided below in
section (d)(3.2.1)(D), the minimum acceptable in-use monitor performance
ratio is:
(A) 0.260 for secondary air system monitors and other cold start related
monitors utilizing a denominator incremented in accordance with section
(d)(4.3.2)(E);
(B) For evaporative system monitors:
(i)  0.260 for monitors designed to detect malfunctions identified in section
(e)(4.2.2)(C) (i.e., 0.020 inch leak detection); and
(ii) 0.520 for monitors designed to detect malfunctions identified in section
(e)(4.2.2)(A) and (B) (i.e., purge flow and 0.040 inch leak detection);
(C) 0.336 for catalyst, oxygen sensor, EGR, VVT system, and all other
monitors specifically required in sections (e) and (f) to meet the monitoring
condition requirements of section (d)(3.2);
(D) For interim years:
(i) through the 2007 model year, for the first  three years a vehicle is
certified to the in-use performance ratio monitoring requirements of
section (d)(3.2), 0.100 for all monitors specified in section (d)(3.2.1)(A)
through (C) above. For example, the 0.100 ratio shall apply to the
2004, 2005, and 2006 model years for vehicles first certified in the
2004 model year and to the 2007, 2008, and 2009 model years for
vehicles first certified in the 2007 model year;
(ii) through the 2014 model year, for fuel system air-fuel ratio cylinder
imbalance monitors, 0.100;
(iii) through the 2011 model year, for secondary exhaust gas sensor
monitors specified in (e)(7.2.2)(C), 0.100;
(iv) through the 2012 model year, for vehicles subject to the monitoring
requirements of section (f), 0.100 for all monitors specified in section
(d)(3.2.1)(C) above;
(v) through the 2016 model year for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, 0.100
for all monitors specifically required in sections (e) and (f) to meet the
monitoring condition requirements of section (d)(3.2) and that are for
systems or components that require engine operation;
(vi) for 2016 through 2018 model year medium-duty vehicles certified to
an engine dynamometer tailpipe emission standard, 0.100 for diesel
PM filter filtering performance monitors (section (f)(9.2.1)) and missing
substrate monitors (section (f)(9.2.5)) not using the denominator
criteria in section(d)(4.3.2)(G).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>3.2.2</dt>
<dd>In addition to meeting the requirements of section (d)(3.2.1),
manufacturers shall implement software algorithms in the OBD II system
to individually track and report in-use performance of the following
monitors in the standardized format specified in section (d)(5):
a. Catalyst (section (e)(1.3) or, where applicable, (f)(1.3));
b. Oxygen/exhaust gas sensor (section (e)(7.3.1)(A) or, where
applicable, (f)(5.3.1)(A));
c. Evaporative system (section (e)(4.3.2));
d. EGR system (section (e)(8.3.1)) and VVT system (section (e)(13.3)
or, where applicable, (f)(6.3.1)(A), (f)(6.3.2), (f)(6.3.4), and,
(f)(13.3));
e. Secondary air system (section (e)(5.3.2)(B));
f. PM filter (section (f)(9.3));
g. NOx adsorber (section (f)(8.3.1)) and NOx catalyst (section
(f)(2.3.1));
h. Secondary oxygen sensor (section (e)(7.3.2)(A));
i. Boost pressure control system (sections (f)(7.3.2) and (f)(7.3.3)); and
j. Fuel system (section (f)(4.3.3)).
The OBD II system is not required to track and report in-use performance
for monitors other than those specifically identified above.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>3.2.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may not use the calculated ratio (or any element thereof) or
any other indication of monitor frequency as a monitoring condition for any
monitor (e.g., using a low ratio to enable more frequent monitoring
through diagnostic executive priority or modification of other monitoring
conditions, or using a high ratio to enable less frequent monitoring).</dd>
