<dt>4.2.1</dt>
<dd>Definition: The numerator is defined as a measure of the number of times
a vehicle has been operated such that all monitoring conditions necessary
for a specific monitor to detect a malfunction have been encountered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.2.2</dt>
<dd>Specifications for incrementing:
<ol type=A>
<li>Except as provided for in sections (d)(4.2.2)(E) and (F), the numerator,
when incremented, shall be incremented by an integer of one. The
numerator may not be incremented more than once per driving cycle.</li>
<li>The numerator for a specific monitor shall be incremented within ten
seconds if and only if the following criteria are satisfied on a single driving
cycle:
<ol type=i>
<li>Every monitoring condition necessary for the monitor of the specific
component to detect a malfunction and store a pending fault code has
been satisfied, including enable criteria, presence or absence of
related fault codes, sufficient length of monitoring time, and diagnostic
executive priority assignments (e.g., diagnostic “A” must execute prior
to diagnostic “B”, etc.). For the purpose of incrementing the
numerator, satisfying all the monitoring conditions necessary for a
monitor to determine the component is passing may not, by itself, be
sufficient to meet this criteria;</li>
<li>For monitors that require multiple stages or events in a single driving
cycle to detect a malfunction, every monitoring condition necessary for
all events to have completed must be satisfied;</li>
<li>For monitors that require intrusive operation of components to detect a
malfunction, a manufacturer shall request Executive Officer approval
of the strategy used to determine that, had a malfunction been
present, the monitor would have detected the malfunction. Executive
Officer approval of the request shall be based on the equivalence of
the strategy to actual intrusive operation and the ability of the strategy
to accurately determine if every monitoring condition necessary for the
intrusive event to occur was satisfied.</li>
<li>In addition to the requirements of section (d)(4.2.2)(B)(i) through (iii)
above, the secondary air system monitor numerator(s) shall be
incremented if and only if the criteria in section (B) above have been
satisfied during normal operation of the secondary air system for
vehicles that require monitoring during normal operation (sections
(e)(5.2.2) through (5.2.4)). Monitoring during intrusive operation of the
secondary air system later in the same driving cycle solely for the
purpose of monitoring may not, by itself, be sufficient to meet this
criteria.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For monitors that can generate results in a “gray zone” or “non-detection
zone” (i.e., results that indicate neither a passing system nor a malfunctioning
system) or in a “non-decision zone” (i.e., results that indicate neither a passing system nor a
malfunctioning system) or in a “non-decision zone” (e.g., monitors that
increment and decrement counters until a pass or fail threshold is
reached), the manufacturer shall submit a plan for appropriate
incrementing of the numerator to the Executive Officer for review and
approval.  In general, the Executive Officer shall not approve plans that
allow the numerator to be incremented when the monitor indicates a result
in the “non-detection zone” or prior to the monitor reaching a decision. In
reviewing the plan for approval, the Executive Officer shall consider data
and/or engineering evaluation submitted by the manufacturer
demonstrating the expected frequency of results in the “non-detection
zone” and the ability of the monitor to accurately determine if a monitor
would have detected a malfunction instead of a result in the “nondetection zone” had an actual malfunction been present.</li>
<li>For monitors that run or complete during engine off operation, the
numerator shall be incremented within 10 seconds after the monitor has
completed during engine off operation or during the first 10 seconds of
engine start on the subsequent driving cycle.</li>
<li>Except as specified in section (d)(4.2.2)(F) for exponentially weighted
moving averages, manufacturers utilizing alternate statistical MIL
illumination protocols as allowed in section (d)(2.2.6) for any of the
monitors requiring a numerator shall submit a plan for appropriate
incrementing of the numerator to the Executive Officer for review and
approval. Executive Officer approval of the plan shall be conditioned
upon the manufacturer providing supporting data and/or engineering
evaluation for the proposed plan, the equivalence of the incrementing in
the manufacturer's plan to the incrementing specified in section (d)(4.2.2)
for monitors using the standard MIL illumination protocol, and the overall
equivalence of the manufacturer's plan in determining that the minimum
acceptable in-use performance ratio in section (d)(3.2.1) is satisfied.</li>
<li>(F) Manufacturers using an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)
as the alternate statistical MIL illumination protocol approved in
accordance with section (d)(2.2.6) shall increment the numerator as
follows:
<ol type=i>
<li>Following a reset or erasure of the EWMA result, the numerator may
not be incremented until after the requisite number of decisions
necessary for MIL illumination have been fully executed.</li>
<li>After the number of decisions required in section (d)(4.2.2)(F)(i) above,
the numerator, when incremented, shall be incremented by an integer
of one and may not be incremented more than once per driving cycle.
Incrementing of the numerator shall also be in accordance with
sections (d)(4.2.2)(B), (C), and (D).</li>
