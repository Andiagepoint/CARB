<dt>16.2</dt>
<dd>For purposes of section (e)(16), emission source systems are components or
devices that emit pollutants subject to vehicle evaporative and exhaust
emission standards (e.g., NMOG, CO, NOx, PM, etc.) and include nonelectronic components and non-powertrain components (e.g., fuel-fired
passenger compartment heaters, on-board reformers, etc.).</dd>
<dt>16.3</dt>
<dd>Except as provided below in this paragraph, for 2005 and subsequent model
year vehicles that utilize emission control systems that alter intake air flow or
cylinder charge characteristics by actuating valve(s), flap(s), etc. in the intake
air delivery system (e.g., swirl control valve systems), the manufacturers, in
addition to meeting the requirements of section (e)(16.1) above, may elect to
have the OBD II system monitor the shaft to which all valves in one intake
bank are physically attached in lieu of monitoring the intake air flow, cylinder
charge, or individual valve(s)/flap(s) for proper functional response. For nonmetal shafts or segmented shafts, the monitor shall verify all shaft segments
for proper functional response (e.g., by verifying the segment or portion of the
shaft furthest from the actuator properly functions). For systems that have
more than one shaft to operate valves in multiple intake banks,
manufacturers are not required to add more than one set of detection
hardware (e.g., sensor, switch, etc.) per intake bank to meet this requirement.
Vehicles utilizing these emission control systems designed and certified for
2004 or earlier model year vehicles and carried over to the 2005 through
2009 model year shall not be required to meet the provisions of section
(e)(16.3) until the engine or intake air delivery system is redesigned.</dd>
