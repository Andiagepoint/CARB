(7.2.1)  Primary Sensors:
(A)  The OBDII system shall detect a malfunction prior to any failure or
deterioration of the oxygen sensor voltage, response rate, amplitude, or
other characteristic(s) (including drift or bias corrected for by secondary
sensors) that would cause a vehicle's emissions to exceed 1.5 times any of
the applicable FTP standards.
(B)  The OBDII system shall detect malfunctions of the oxygen sensor caused by
either a lack of circuit continuity or out of range values.
(C)  The OBDII system shall detect a malfunction of the oxygen sensor when a
sensor failure or deterioration causes the fuel system to stop using that
sensor as a feedback input (e.g., causes default or open loop operation).
(D)  The OBDII system shall detect a malfunction of the oxygen sensor when the
sensor output voltage, amplitude, activity, or other characteristics are no
longer sufficient for use as an OBDII system monitoring device (e.g., for
catalyst monitoring).
(7.2.2)  Secondary Sensors:
(A)  The OBDII system shall detect a malfunction prior to any failure or
deterioration of the oxygen sensor voltage, response rate, amplitude, or
other characteristic(s) that would cause a vehicle's emissions to exceed 1.5
times any of the applicable FTP standards.
(B)  The OBDII system shall detect malfunctions of the oxygen sensor caused by
a lack of circuit continuity.
(C)  To the extent feasible, the OBDII system shall detect a malfunction of the
oxygen sensor when the sensor output voltage, amplitude, activity, or other
characteristics are no longer sufficient for use as an OBDII system
monitoring device (e.g., for catalyst monitoring).
36
(D)  The OBDII system shall detect malfunctions of the oxygen sensor caused by
out of range values.
(7.2.3)  Sensor Heaters:
(A)  The OBDII system shall detect a malfunction of the heater performance
when the current or voltage drop in the heater circuit is no longer within the
manufacturer's specified limits for normal operation (i.e., within the criteria
required to be met by the component vendor for heater circuit performance at
high mileage). Subject to Executive Officer approval, other malfunction
criteria for heater performance malfunctions may be used upon the Executive
Officer determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and/or an
engineering evaluation that demonstrate the monitoring reliability and
timeliness to be equivalent to the stated criteria in section (e)(7.2.3)(A).
(B)  The OBDII system shall detect malfunctions of the heater circuit including
open or short circuits that conflict with the commanded state of the heater
(e.g., shorted to 12 Volts when commanded to 0 Volts (ground), etc.).
