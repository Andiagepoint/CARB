(7.3.1) Primary Sensors
(A)  Manufacturers shall define the monitoring conditions for malfunctions
identified in  sections (e)(7.2.1)(A) and (D) (e.g., proper response rate) in
accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio
requirements). For purposes of tracking and reporting as required in section
(d)(3.2.2), all monitors used to detect malfunctions identified in sections
(e)(7.2.1)(A) and (D) shall be tracked separately but reported as a single set
of values as specified in section (d)(5.2.2).
(B)  Except as provided in section (e)(7.3.1)(C), monitoring for malfunctions
identified in sections (e)(7.2.1)(B) and (C) (i.e., circuit continuity, out-ofrange, and open-loop malfunctions) shall be:
(i)  Conducted in accordance with title 13, CCR section 1968.1 for Low
Emission Vehicle I applications and 2004 and 2005 model year Low
Emission Vehicle II applications;
(ii)  Conducted continuously for all 2006 and subsequent model year Low
Emission Vehicle II applications.
(C)  A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable
continuous oxygen sensor monitoring when an oxygen sensor malfunction
cannot be distinguished from other effects (e.g., disable out-of-range low
monitoring during fuel cut conditions). The Executive Officer shall approve
the disablement upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted test
data and/or documentation that demonstrate a properly functioning sensor
cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning sensor and that the
disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false
detection.

(7.3.2) Secondary Sensors
(A)  Manufacturers shall define monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified
in  sections (e)(7.2.2)(A), (B), and (C) (e.g., proper sensor activity) in
accordance with sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio
requirements).
(B)  Except as provided in section (e)(7.3.2)(C), monitoring for malfunctions
identified in section (e)(7.2.2)(D) (i.e., out-of-range malfunctions) shall be:
(i)  Conducted in accordance with title 13, CCR section 1968.1 for Low
Emission Vehicle I applications and 2004 and 2005 model year Low
Emission Vehicle II applications;
(ii)  Conducted continuously for all 2006 and subsequent model year Low
Emission Vehicle II applications.
(C)  A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable
continuous oxygen sensor monitoring when an oxygen sensor malfunction
cannot be distinguished from other effects (e.g., disable out-of-range low
monitoring during fuel cut conditions). The Executive Officer shall approve
the disablement upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted test
data and/or documentation that demonstrate a properly functioning sensor
cannot be distinguished from a malfunctioning sensor and that the
disablement interval is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false
detection.
(7.3.3) Sensor Heaters
(A)  Manufacturers shall define monitoring conditions for malfunctions identified
in section (e) (7.2.3)(A) (e.g., sensor heater performance) in accordance
sections (d)(3.1) and (d)(3.2) (i.e., minimum ratio requirements).
(B)   Monitoring for malfunctions identified in section (e)(7.2.3)(B) (e.g., circuit
malfunctions) shall be:
(i)  Conducted in accordance with title 13, CCR section 1968.1 for 2004 and
2005 model year vehicles;
(ii)   Conducted continuously for all 2006 and subsequent model year vehicles.
