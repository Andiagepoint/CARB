(7.1.1) The OBDII system shall monitor the output voltage, response rate, and any
other parameter which can affect emissions of all primary (fuel control)
oxygen (lambda) sensors for malfunction. Both the lean -to-rich and
rich -to-lean response rates shall be monitored.
(7.1.2) The OBDII system shall also monitor all secondary oxygen sensors (those
used for fuel trim control or as a monitoring device) for proper output voltage,
activity, and/or response rate.
(7.1.3) For vehicles equipped with heated oxygen sensors, the OBDII system shall
monitor the heater for proper performance.
(7.1.4)  For other types of sensors (e.g., wide range or universal lambda sensors,
etc.), the manufacturer shall submit a monitoring plan to the Executive Officer
for approval. The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the manufacturer has submitted data and an engineering
evaluation that demonstrate that the monitoring plan is as reliable and
effective as the monitoring plan required for conventional sensors under
section (e)(7).
