illumination during the test, fault code(s) and freeze frame information stored
at the time of detection, corresponding SAE J1979 test results (e.g.
Mode/Service $06) stored during the test, and a description of the modified or
deteriorated components used for fault simulation with respect to the
demonstration tests specified in section (h). The Executive Officer may
approve conditional certification of a test group prior to the submittal of this
data for ARB review and approval. Factors to be considered by the Executive
Officer in approving the late submission of information identified in section
(i)(2.4) shall include the reason for the delay in the data collection, the length
of time until data will be available, and the demonstrated previous success of
the manufacturer in submitting the data prior to certification.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dt>2.5.1</dt>
<dd>For gasoline vehicles, data supporting the misfire monitor shall include:
<ol type=A>
<li>The established percentage of misfire that can be tolerated without
damaging the catalyst over the full range of engine speed and load
conditions.</li>
<li>Data demonstrating the probability of detection of misfire events of the
misfire monitoring system over the full engine speed and load operating
range for the following misfire patterns: random cylinders misfiring at the
malfunction criteria established in section (e)(3.2.2), one cylinder
continuously misfiring, and paired cylinders continuously misfiring.</li>
<li>Data identifying all disablement of misfire monitoring that occurs during
the FTP and US06 cycles. For every disablement that occurs during the
cycles, the data should identify: when the disablement occurred relative to
the driver’s trace, the number of engine revolutions that each disablement
was present for, and which disable condition documented in the
certification application caused the disablement. The data shall be
submitted in the standardized format detailed in Attachment A: Misfire
Disablement and Detection Chart of ARB Mail-Out #06-23, December 21,
2006, incorporated by reference.</li>
<li>Manufacturers are not required to use the durability demonstration vehicle
to collect the misfire data for sections (i)(2.5.1)(A) though (C).</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>2.5.2</dt>
<dd>For diesel medium-duty vehicles subject to the monitoring requirements of
section (f)(3.2.2), data supporting the misfire monitor shall include:
<ol type=A>
<li>Data demonstrating the probability of detection of misfire events of the
misfire monitoring system over the required engine speed and load
operating range for the following misfire patterns: random cylinders
misfiring at the malfunction criteria established in section (f)(3.2.2), one
cylinder continuously misfiring, and paired cylinders continuously misfiring.</li>
<li>Data identifying all disablement of misfire monitoring that occurs during
the chassis dynamometer FTP and Unified cycles. For every disablement
that occurs during the cycles, the data shall identify: when the
disablement occurred relative to the driver’s trace, the number of engine
revolutions that each disablement was present for, and which disab le
condition documented in the certification application caused the
disablement. The number of 1000-revolution intervals completed and the
number of 1000-revoluation intervals in which the misfire threshold was
exceeded shall also be identified. The data shall be submitted in the
standardized format detailed in Attachment A: Misfire Disablement and
