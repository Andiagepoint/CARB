The following information shall be submitted as “Part 1” of the certification
application. Except as provided below for demonstration data, the Executive
Officer will not issue an Executive Order certifying the covered vehicles without the
information having been provided. The information must include:
(2.1)  A description of the functional operation of the OBDII system including a
complete written description for each monitoring strategy that outlines every step
in the decision making process of the monitor. Algorithms, diagrams, samples
of data, and/or other graphical representations of the monitoring strategy shall
be included where necessary to adequately describe the information.
(2.2)  A table, in the standardized format detailed in Attachment A of ARB Mail-Out
#95-20, May 22, 1995, incorporated by reference.
71
(2.2.1) The table must include the following information for each monitored
component or system (either computer-sensed or -controlled) of the
emission control system:
(A)  corresponding fault code
(B)  monitoring method or procedure for malfunction detection
(C)   primary malfunction detection parameter and its type of output signal
(D)   fault criteria limits used to evaluate output signal of primary parameter
(E)   other monitored secondary parameters and conditions (in engineering units)
necessary for malfunction detection
(F)  monitoring time length and frequency of checks
(G) criteria for storing fault code
(H)  criteria for illuminating malfunction indicator light
(I)  criteria used for determining out of range values and input component
rationality checks
(2.2.2)  Wherever possible, the table shall use the following engineering units:
(A)   Degrees Celsius (&deg;C) for all temperature criteria
(B)   KiloPascals (KPa) for all pressure criteria related to manifold or atmospheric
pressure
(C)  Grams (g) for all intake air mass criteria
(D)   Pascals (Pa) for all pressure criteria related to evaporative system vapor
pressure
(E)  Miles per hour (mph) for all vehicle speed criteria
(F)  Relative percent (%) for all relative throttle position criteria (as defined in
SAE J1979)
(G) Voltage (V) for all absolute throttle position criteria (as defined in SAE
J1979)
(H) Per crankshaft revolution (/rev) for all changes per ignition event based
criteria (e.g., g/rev instead of g/stroke or g/firing)
(I)  Per second (/sec) for all changes per time based criteria (e.g., g/sec)
(J) Percent of nominal tank volume (%) for all fuel tank level criteria
(2.3)  A logic flowchart describing the step by step evaluation of the enable criteria and
malfunction criteria for each monitored emission-related component or system.
(2.4)  Emission test data, a description of the testing sequence (e.g., the number and
types of preconditioning cycles), approximate time (in seconds) of MIL
illumination during the test, fault code(s) and freeze frame information stored at
the time of detection, corresponding SAE J1979 test results (e.g. Mode/Service
$06) stored during the test, and a description of the modified or deteriorated
components used for fault simulation with respect to the demonstration tests
specified in section (g). The Executive Officer may approve conditional
certification of a test group prior to the submittal of this data for ARB review and
approval.  Factors to be considered by the Executive Officer in approving the
late submission of information identified in section (h)(2.4) shall include the
reason for the delay in the data collection, the length of time until data will be
available, and the demonstrated previous success of the manufacturer in
submitting the data prior to certification.
(2.5)  Data supporting the misfire monitor, including:
72
(2.5.1)  The established percentage of misfire that can be tolerated without
damaging the catalyst over the full range of engine speed and load
conditions.
(2.5.2) Data demonstrating the probability of detection of misfire events of the
misfire monitoring system over the full engine speed and load operating
range for the following misfire patterns: random cylinders misfiring at the
malfunction criteria established in section (e)(3.2.2), one cylinder
continuously misfiring, and paired cylinders continuously misfiring.
(2.5.3) Data identifying all disablement of misfire monitoring that occurs during the
FTP and US06 cycles. For every disablement that occurs during the cycles,
the data should identify: when the disablement occurred relative to the
driver’s trace, the number of engine revolutions that each disablement was
present for, and which disable condition documented in the certification
application caused the disablement.
(2.5.4) Manufacturers are not required to use the durability demonstration vehicle to
collect the misfire data for sections (h)(2.5.1) though (2.5.3).
(2.6)  Data supporting the limit for the time between engine starting and attaining the
designated heating temperature for after-start heated catalyst systems.
(2.7)  A listing of all electronic powertrain input and output signals (including those not
monitored by the OBDII system) that identifies which signals are monitored by
the OBDII system.
(2.8)  A written description of all parameters and conditions necessary to begin closed
loop operation.
(2.9)  A summary table identifying every test group and each of the OBDII phase-in
requirements that apply to each test group.
(2.10)  A written identification of the communication protocol utilized by each test group
for communication with an SAE J1978 scan tool.
(2.11)  A pictorial representation or written description of the diagnostic connector
location including any covers or labels.
(2.12)  A written description of the method used by the manufacturer to meet the
requirements of section (e)(9) for PCV system monitoring including diagrams or
pictures of valve and/or hose connections.
(2.13)  Any other information determined by the Executive Officer to be necessary to
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this regulation.
