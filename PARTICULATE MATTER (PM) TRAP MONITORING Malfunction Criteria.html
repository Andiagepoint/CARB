(15.2.1) For 2004 and subsequent model year diesel passenger cars, light-duty
trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe standard, the OBDII system shall detect a malfunction
prior to a decrease in the capability of the PM trap that would cause a
vehicle's emissions to exceed 1.5 times the applicable standards.
(15.2.2) For 2005 and 2006 model year diesel medium-duty vehicles (including
medium-duty passenger vehicles certified to an engine dynamometer
tailpipe standard), the OBDII system shall detect a malfunction of the PM
trap when catastrophic failure occurs. The Executive Officer shall exempt
vehicles from this PM trap monitoring requirement upon determining that the
manufacturer has demonstrated with data and/or engineering evaluation that
catastrophic failure of the PM trap will not cause emissions to exceed 1.5
times the applicable standards.
(15.2.3) For 2007 and subsequent model year diesel medium-duty vehicles, the
OBDII system shall detect a malfunction prior to a decrease in the capability
of the PM trap that would cause a vehicle's emissions to exceed 1.5 times
the applicable standards.
(15.2.4)  For vehicles subject to the malfunction criteria in sections (e)(15.2.1) or
(15.2.3) above, if no failure or deterioration of the PM trap could result in a
vehicle’s emissions exceeding 1.5 times any of the applicable standards, the
OBDII system shall detect a malfunction when catastrophic failure of the PM
trap occurs.
