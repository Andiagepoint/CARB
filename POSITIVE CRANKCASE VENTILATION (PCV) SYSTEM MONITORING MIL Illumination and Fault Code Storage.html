General requirements for MIL
illumination and fault code storage are set forth in section (d)(2).  The stored fault
code need not specifically identify the PCV system (e.g., a fault code for idle
speed control or fuel system monitoring can be stored) if the manufacturer
demonstrates that additional monitoring hardware would be necessary to make
this identification, and provided the manufacturer’s diagnostic and repair
procedures for the detected malfunction include directions to check the integrity
of the PCV system.
