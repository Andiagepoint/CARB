(9.2.1)  For the purposes of section (e)(9), “PCV system” is defined as any form of
crankcase ventilation system, regardless of whether it utilizes positive
pressure. “PCV valve” is defined as any form of valve or orifice used to
restrict or control crankcase vapor flow.  Further, any additional external PCV
system tubing or hoses used to equalize crankcase pressure or to provide a
ventilation path between various areas of the engine (e.g., crankcase and
valve cover) are considered part of the PCV system “between the crankcase
and the PCV valve” and subject to the malfunction criteria in section
(e)(9.2.2) below.
39
(9.2.2) Except as provided below, the OBDII system shall detect a malfunction of the
PCV system when a disconnection of the system occurs between either the
crankcase and the PCV valve, or between the PCV valve and the intake
manifold.
(9.2.3) If the PCV system is designed such that the PCV valve is fastened directly to
the crankcase in a manner which makes it significantly more difficult to
remove the valve from the crankcase rather than disconnect the line between
the valve and the intake manifold (taking aging effects into consideration),
the Executive Officer shall exempt the manufacturer from detection of
disconnection between the crankcase and the PCV valve.
(9.2.4) Subject to Executive Officer approval, system designs that utilize tubing
between the valve and the crankcase shall also be exempted from the
portion of the monitoring requirement for detection of disconnection between
the crankcase and the PCV valve. The manufacturer shall file a request and
submit data and/or engineering evaluation in support of the request.  The
Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the
connections between the valve and the crankcase are: (i ) resistant to
deterioration or accidental disconnection, (ii) significantly more difficult to
disconnect than the line between the valve and the intake manifold, and (iii)
not subject to disconnection per manufacturer’s repair procedures for nonPCV system repair work.
(9.2.5)  Manufacturers are not required to detect disconnectionsbetween the PCV
valve and the intake manifold if said disconnection (1) causes the vehicle to
stall immediately during idle operation; or (2) is unlikely to occur due to a
PCV system design that is integral to the induction system (e.g., machined
passages rather than tubing or hoses).
