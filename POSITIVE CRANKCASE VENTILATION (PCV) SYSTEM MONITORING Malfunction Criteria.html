<dt>9.2.1</dt>
<dd>For the purposes of section (e)(9), “PCV system” is defined as any form of
crankcase ventilation system, regardless of whether it utilizes positive
pressure. “PCV valve” is defined as any form of valve or orifice used to
restrict or control crankcase vapor flow. Further, any additional external
PCV system tubing or hoses used to equalize crankcase pressure or to
provide a ventilation path between various areas of the engine (e.g.,
crankcase and valve cover) are considered part of the PCV system
“between the crankcase and the PCV valve” and subject to the
malfunction criteria in section (e)(9.2.2) below.</dd>
<dt>9.2.2</dt>
<dd>Except as provided below, the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction of
the PCV system when a disconnection of the system occurs between
either the crankcase and the PCV valve, or between the PCV valve and
the intake manifold.</dd>
<dt>9.2.3</dt>
<dd>If the PCV system is designed such that the PCV valve is fastened directly
to the crankcase in a manner which makes it significantly more difficult to
remove the valve from the crankcase rather than disconnect the line
between the valve and the intake manifold (taking aging effects into
consideration), the Executive Officer shall exempt the manufacturer from
detection of disconnection between the crankcase and the PCV valve.</dd>
<dt>9.2.4</dt>
<dd>Subject to Executive Officer approval, system designs that utilize tubing
between the valve and the crankcase shall also be exempted from the
portion of the monitoring requirement for detection of disconnection
between the crankcase and the PCV valve. The manufacturer shall file a
request and submit data and/or engineering evaluation in support of the
request. The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon
determining that the connections between the valve and the crankcase
are: (i) resistant to deterioration or accidental disconnection, (ii)
significantly more difficult to disconnect than the line between the valve
and the intake manifold, and (iii) not subject to disconnection per
manufacturer’s repair procedures for non-PCV system repair work.</dd>
<dt>9.2.5</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers are not required to detect disconnections between the PCV
valve and the intake manifold if said disconnection (1) causes the vehicle
to stall immediately during idle operation; or (2) is unlikely to occur due to
a PCV system design that is integral to the induction system (e.g.,
machined passages rather than tubing or hoses).</dd>
