<div id="kasten">The purpose of this regulation is to reduce motor vehicle and motor vehicle engine
emissions by establishing emission standards and other requirements for onboard
diagnostic systems (OBD II systems) that are installed on 2004 and subsequent
model-year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles and
engines certified for sale in California. The OBD II systems, through the use of an
onboard computer(s), shall monitor emission systems in-use for the actual life of the
vehicle and shall be capable of detecting malfunctions of the monitored emission
systems, illuminating a malfunction indicator light (MIL) to notify the vehicle operator
of detected malfunctions, and storing fault codes identifying the detected
malfunctions. The use and operation of OBD systems will ensure reductions in inuse motor vehicle and motor vehicle engine emissions through improvements of
emission system durability and performance.</div>
