In accordance with SAE J1979 specifications, the OBD II
system shall indicate “complete” or “not complete” since the fault memory
was last cleared for each of the installed monitored components and systems
identified in sections (e)(1) through (e)(8), (e)(15), (f)(1) through (f)(4), (f)(6),
(f)(8), and (f)(15). All 2010 and subsequent model year diesel vehicles shall
additionally indicate the appropriate readiness status for monitors identified in
sections (f)(5), (f)(7), and (f)(9). All 2010 subsequent model year vehicles
equipped with VVT system monitoring and subject to the test results
requirements specified in section (g)(4.5.4)(C) shall additionally indicate the
appropriate readiness status for VVT system monitors identified in sections
(e)(13) and (f)(13). All components or systems that are monitored
continuously shall always indicate “complete”. Those components or
systems that are not subject to continuous monitoring shall immediately
indicate “complete” upon the respective diagnostic(s) being fully executed
and determining that the component or system is not malfunctioning. A
component or system shall also indicate “complete” if after the requisite
number of decisions necessary for determining MIL status have been fully
executed, the monitor indicates a malfunction for the component or system.
The status for each of the monitored components or systems shall indicate
“not complete” whenever fault memory has been cleared or erased by a
means other than that allowed in section (d)(2). Normal vehicle shut down
(i.e., key off, engine off) may not cause the status to indicate “not complete”.

<dt>4.1.1</dt>
<dd>Subject to Executive Officer approval, if monitoring is disabled for a
multiple number of driving cycles due to the continued presence of
extreme operating conditions (e.g., cold ambient temperatures, high
altitudes, etc), readiness status for the subject monitoring system may be
set to indicate “complete” without monitoring having been completed.
Executive Officer approval shall be based on the conditions for monitoring
system disablement and the number of driving cycles specified without
completion of monitoring before readiness is indicated as “complete”. </dd>
<dt>4.1.2</dt>
<dd>For the evaporative system monitor:
<ol type=A>
<li>Except as provided below in section (g)(4.1.2)(B), the readiness status
shall be set in accordance with section (g)(4.1) when both the functional
check of the purge valve and the leak detection monitor of the orifice size
specified in either section (e)(4.2.2)(B) or (C) (e.g., 0.040 inch or 0.020
inch) indicate that they are complete.</li>
<li>For vehicles that utilize a 0.090 inch (in lieu of 0.040 inch) leak detection
monitor in accordance with section (e)(4.2.5), the readiness status shall
be set in accordance with section (g)(4.1) when both the functional check
of the purge valve and the leak detection monitor of the orifice size
specified in section (e)(4.2.2)(C) (e.g., 0.020 inch) indicate that they are
complete.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>4.1.3</dt>
<dd>If the manufacturer elects to additionally indicate readiness status through
the MIL in the key on, engine off position as provided for in section
(d)(2.1.3), the readiness status shall be indicated in the following manner:
If the readiness status for all monitored components or systems is
“complete”, the MIL shall remain continuously illuminated in the key on,
engine off position for at least 15-20 seconds. If the readiness status for
one or more of the monitored components or systems is “not complete”,
after 15-20 seconds of operation in the key on, engine off position with the
MIL illuminated continuously, the MIL shall blink once per second for 5-10
seconds. The data stream value for MIL status (section (g)(4.2)) shall
indicate “commanded off” during this sequence unless the MIL has also
been “commanded on” for a detected fault.</dd>
