In accordance with SAE J1979 specifications, the OBDII
system shall indicate “complete” or “not complete” for each of the installed
monitored components and systems identified in section (e)(1) through (e)(8)
since the fault memory was last cleared. All components or systems that are
monitored continuously shall always indicate “complete”. Those components or
systems that are not subject to continuous monitoring shall immediately indicate
“complete” upon the respective diagnostic(s) being fully executed and
determining that the component or system is not malfunctioning. A component
or system shall also indicate “complete” if after the requisite number of decisions
necessary for determining MIL status have been fully executed, the monitor
indicates a malfunction for the component or system. The status for each of the
monitored components or systems shall indicate “not complete” whenever fault
memory has been cleared or erased by a means other than that allowed in
section (d)(2). Normal vehicle shut down (i.e., key off, engine off) may not cause
the status to indicate “not complete”.
<ol>
<li>Subject to Executive Officer approval, if monitoring is disabled for a multiple
number of driving cycles due to the continued presence of extreme operating
conditions (e.g., cold ambient temperatures, high altitudes, etc), readiness
status for the subject monitoring system may be set to indicate “complete”
without monitoring having been completed. Executive Officer approval shall
be based on the conditions for monitoring system disablement and the
number of driving cycles specified without completion of monitoring before
readiness is indicated as “complete”.</li>
<li>For the evaporative system monitor:
<ol type=A>
<li>Except as provided below in section (f)(4.1.2)(B), the readiness status shall be set
in accordance with section (f)(4.1) when both the functional check of the purge valve and
the leak detection monitor of the orifice size specified in either section (e)(4.2.2)(B)
or (C) (e.g., 0.040 inch or 0.020 inch) indicate that they are complete.</li>
</ol>
<ol type=A start=2>
<li>For vehicles that utilize a 0.090 inch (in lieu of 0.040 inch) leak detection
monitor in accordance with section (e)(4.2.5), the readiness status shall be
set in accordance with section (f)(4.1) when both the functional check of the
purge valve and the leak detection monitor of the orifice size specified in
section (e)(4.2.2) (B) or (C) (e.g., 0.020 inch) indicate that they are complete.</li>
</ol>
<li>If the manufacturer elects to additionally indicate readiness status through the
MIL in the key on, engine off position as provided for in section (d)(2.1.4), the
readiness status shall be indicated in the following manner: If the readiness
status for all monitored components or systems is “complete”, the MIL shall
remain continuously illuminated in the key on, engine off position for at least
15-20 seconds. If the readiness status for one or more of the monitored
components or systems is “not complete”, after 15-20 seconds of operation
in the key on, engine off position with the MIL illuminated continuously, the
MIL shall blink once per second for 5-10 seconds. The data stream value for
MIL status (section (f)(4.2)) shall indicate “commanded off” during this
sequence unless the MIL has also been “commanded on” for a detected fault.</li>
</ol>
