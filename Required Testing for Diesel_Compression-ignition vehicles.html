Except as provided below, the manufacturer shall perform single-fault testing
based on the applicable test with the following components/systems set at their
malfunction criteria limits as determined by the manufacturer for meeting the
requirements of section (f).
<dl>
<dt>4.1</dt>
<dd>NMHC Catalyst: The manufacturer shall perform a separate test for each
monitored NMHC catalyst(s) that is used for a different purpose (e.g.,
oxidation catalyst upstream of a PM filter, NMHC catalyst used downstream
of an SCR catalyst). The catalyst(s) being evaluated shall be deteriorated to
the applicable malfunction criteria established by the manufacturer in section
(f)(1.2.2) using methods established by the manufacturer in accordance with
section (f)(1.2.4). For each monitored NMHC catalyst(s), the manufacturer
shall also demonstrate that the OBD II system will detect a catalyst
malfunction with the catalyst at its maximum level of deterioration (i.e., the
substrate(s) completely removed from the catalyst container or “empty” can).
Emission data are not required for the empty can demonstration.</dd>
<dt>4.2.</dt>
<dd>NOx Catalyst: The manufacturer shall perform a separate test for each
monitored NOx catalyst(s) that is used for a different purpose (e.g., passive
lean NOx catalyst, SCR catalyst). The catalyst(s) being evaluated shall be
deteriorated to the applicable malfunction criteria established by the
manufacturer in sections (f)(2.2.2)(A) and (f)(2.2.3)(A) using methods
established by the manufacturer in accordance with section (f)(2.2.4). For
each monitored NOx catalyst(s), the manufacturer shall also demonstrate that
the OBD II system will detect a catalyst malfunction with the catalyst at its
maximum level of deterioration (i.e., the substrate(s) completely removed
from the catalyst container or “empty” can). Emission data are not required
for the empty can demonstration.</dd>
<dt>4.3</dt>
<dd>Misfire Monitoring: For 2010 and subsequent model year vehicles subject to
section (f)(3.2.2)(A)(i) or (f)(3.2.5), the manufacturer shall perform a test at
the malfunction criteria limit specified in section (f)(3.2.2)(A)(i) or (f)(3.2.5). A
misfire monitor demonstration test is not required for vehicles not subject to
section (f)(3.2.2)(A)(i) and not subject to section (f)(3.2.5).</dd>
<dt>4.4</dt>
<dd>Fuel System: The manufacturer shall perform a separate test for each
applicable malfunction limit established by the manufacturer for the fuel
system parameters (e.g., fuel pressure, injection timing, injection quantity)
specified in sections (f)(4.2.1) through (f)(4.2.3). When performing a test for
a specific parameter, the fuel system shall be operating at the malfunction
criteria limit for the applicable parameter only. All other parameters shall be
with normal characteristics. In conducting the fuel system demonstration
tests, the manufacturer may use computer modifications to cause the fuel
system to operate at the malfunction limit if the manufacturer can
demonstrate to the Executive Officer that the computer modifications produce
test results equivalent to an induced hardware malfunction.</dd>
<dt>4.5</dt>
<dd>Exhaust Gas Sensor: The manufacturer shall perform a test for each exhaust
gas sensor parameter calibrated to the malfunction criteria in sections
(f)(5.2.1)(A)(i), (f)(5.2.1)(B)(i), and (f)(5.2.2)(A). When performing a test, all
exhaust gas sensors used for the same purpose (e.g., for the same feedback
control loop, for the same control feature on parallel exhaust banks) shall be
operating at the malfunction criteria limit for the applicable parameter only.
All other exhaust gas sensor parameters shall be with normal characteristics.</dd>
<dt>4.6</dt>
<dd>EGR System: The manufacturer shall perform a test at each flow, slow
response, and cooling limit calibrated to the malfunction criteria in sections
(f)(6.2.1) through (f)(6.2.3) and (f)(6.2.5).  In conducting the EGR cooler
performance demonstration test, the EGR cooler(s) being evaluated shall be
deteriorated to the applicable malfunction criteria using methods established
by the manufacturer in accordance with section (f)(6.2.5)(C).  In conducting
the EGR system slow response demonstration tests, the manufacturer may
use computer modifications to cause the EGR system to operate at the
malfunction limit if the manufacturer can demonstrate to the Executive Officer
that the computer modifications produce test results equivalent to an induced
hardware malfunction or that there is no reasonably feasible method to
induce a hardware malfunction.</dd>
<dt>4.7</dt>
<dd>Boost Pressure Control System: The manufacturer shall perform a test at
each boost, response, and cooling limit calibrated to the malfunction criteria
in sections (f)(7.2.1) through (f)(7.2.4).  In conducting the charge air
undercooling demonstration test, the charge air cooler(s) being evaluated
shall be deteriorated to the applicable malfunction criteria established by the
manufacturer in section (f)(7.2.4)(A) using methods established by the
manufacturer in accordance with section (f)(7.2.4)(C).</dd>
<dt>4.8</dt>
<dd>NOx Adsorber: The manufacturer shall perform a test using a NOx
adsorber(s) deteriorated to the malfunction criteria in section (f)(8.2.1). The
manufacturer shall also demonstrate that the OBD II system will detect a NOx
adsorber malfunction with the NOx adsorber at its maximum level of
deterioration (i.e., the substrate(s) completely removed from the container or
“empty” can). Emission data are not required for the empty can
demonstration.</dd>
<dt>4.9</dt>
<dd>PM Filter: The manufacturer shall perform a test using a PM filter(s)
deteriorated to each applicable malfunction criteria in sections (f)(9.2.1),
(f)(9.2.2), and (f)(9.2.4). The manufacturer shall also demonstrate that the
OBD II system will detect a PM filter malfunction with the filter at its maximum
level of deterioration (i.e., the filter(s) completely removed from the filter
container or “empty” can). Emission data are not required for the empty can
demonstration.</dd>
<dt>4.10</dt>
<dd>Cold Start Emission Reduction Strategy: The manufacturer shall perform a
test at the malfunction criteria for the system or for each component
monitored according to section (f)(12.2.2).</dd>
<dt>4.11</dt>
<dd>VVT System: The manufacturer shall perform a test at each target error limit
and slow response limit calibrated to the malfunction criteria in sections
(f)(13.2.1) and (f)(13.2.2). In conducting the VVT system demonstration
tests, the manufacturer may use computer modifications to cause the VVT
system to operate at the malfunction limit if the manufacturer can
demonstrate to the Executive Officer that the computer modifications produce
test results equivalent to an induced hardware malfunction.</dd>
<dt>4.12</dt>
<dd>For each of the testing requirements of section (h)(4), if the manufacturer has
established that only a functional check is required because no failure or
deterioration of the specific tested system could result in an engine’s
emissions exceeding the emission malfunction criteria, the manufacturer is
not required to perform a demonstration test; however the manufacturer is
required to provide the data and/or engineering analysis used to determine
that only a functional test of the system(s) is required.</dd>
<dt>4.13</dt>
<dd>For each of the testing requirements of (h)(4), when performing a test, all
components or systems used in parallel for the same purpose (e.g., separate
VVT actuators on the intake valves for Bank 1 and Bank 2, separate NOx
converting catalysts on parallel exhaust banks) shall be simultaneously
deteriorated to the malfunction criteria limit. Components or systems in
series or used for different purposes (e.g., upstream and downstream
exhaust gas sensors in a single exhaust bank, separate high pressure and
low pressure EGR systems) may not be simultaneously deteriorated to the
malfunction criteria limit.</dd>
<dt>4.14</dt>
<dd>The manufacturer may electronically simulate deteriorated components if the
manufacturer can demonstrate to the Executive Officer that the computer
modifications produce test results equivalent to an induced hardware
malfunction but may not make any engine control unit modifications (unless
otherwise provided above or exempted pursuant to this section) when
performing demonstration tests.  All equipment necessary to duplicate the
demonstration test must be made available to ARB upon request.  A
manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to electronically
simulate a deteriorated component with engine control unit modifications.
The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining the
manufacturer has submitted data and/or engineering analysis demonstrating
that it is technically infeasible, very difficult, and/or resource intensive to
implant the fault with modifications external to the engine control  unit.</dd>
