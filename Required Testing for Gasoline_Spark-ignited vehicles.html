Except as provided below, the manufacturer shall perform single-fault testing
based on the applicable FTP test with the following components/systems set at
their malfunction criteria limits as determined by the manufacturer for meeting
the requirements of section (e):
<dl>
<dt>3.1</dt>
<dd>Exhaust Gas Sensors:
(3.1.1) The manufacturer shall perform a test with all primary oxygen sensors
(conventional switching sensors and wide range or universal sensors)
used for fuel control simultaneously possessing a response rate
deteriorated to the malfunction criteria limit. Manufacturers shall also
perform a test for any other oxygen sensor parameter that can cause
vehicle emissions to exceed the malfunction threshold (e.g., 1.5 times the
applicable standards due to a shift in air/fuel ratio at which oxygen sensor
switches, decreased amplitude, etc.). When performing additional test(s),
all primary and secondary (if applicable) oxygen sensors used for fuel
control shall be operating at the malfunction criteria limit for the applicable
parameter only. All other primary and secondary oxygen sensor
parameters shall be with normal characteristics.
(3.1.2) For vehicles utilizing sensors other than oxygen sensors for primary fuel
control (e.g., hydrocarbon sensors, etc.), the manufacturer shall submit,
for Executive Officer approval, a demonstration test plan for performing
testing of all of the sensor parameters that can cause vehicle emissions to
exceed the malfunction threshold (e.g., 1.5 times the applicable
standards). The Executive Officer shall approve the plan if it is
determined that it will provide data that will assure proper performance of
the diagnostics of the sensors, consistent with the intent of section  (h).</dd>
<dt>3.2</dt>
<dd>EGR System: The manufacturer shall perform a test at the low flow limit.</dd>
<dt>3.3</dt>
<dd>VVT System: For 2006 through 2008 model year Low Emission II applications
and all 2009 and subsequent model year vehicles, the manufacturer shall
perform a test at each target error limit and slow response limit calibrated to
the malfunction criteria (e.g., 1.5 times the FTP standard) in sections
(e)(13.2.1) and (13.2.2). In conducting the VVT system d emonstration tests,
the manufacturer may use computer modifications to cause the VVT system
to operate at the malfunction limit if the manufacturer can demonstrate that
the computer modifications produce test results equivalent to an induced
hardware malfunction.</dd>
<dt>3.4</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>3.4.1</dt>
<dd>For vehicles with adaptive feedback based on the primary fuel control
sensor(s), the manufacturer shall perform a test with the adaptive
feedback based on the primary fuel control sensor(s) at the rich limit(s)
and a test at the lean limit(s) established by the manufacturer in section
(e)(6.2.1) to detect a malfunction before emissions exceed  the
malfunction threshold (e.g., 1.5 times the applicable standards).</dd>
<dt>3.4.2</dt>
<dd>For vehicles with feedback based on a secondary fuel control sensor(s)
and subject to the malfunction criteria in section (e)(6.2.1), the
manufacturer shall perform a test with the feedback based on the
secondary fuel control sensor(s) at the rich limit(s) and a test at the lean
limit(s) established by the manufacturer in section  (e)(6.2.1) to detect a
malfunction before emissions exceed the malfunction threshold (e.g., 1.5
times the applicable standards).</dd>
<dt>3.4.3</dt>
<dd>For other fuel metering or control systems, the manufacturer shall perform
a test at the criteria limit(s).</dd>
<dt>3.4.4</dt>
<dd>For purposes of fuel system testing, the fault(s) induced may result in a
uniform distribution of fuel and air among the cylinders. Non-uniform
distribution of fuel and air used to induce a fault may not cause misfire. In
conducting the fuel system demonstration tests, the manufacturer may
use computer modifications to cause the fuel system to operate at the
malfunction limit if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the computer
modifications produce test results equivalent to an induced hardware
malfunction.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>3.5</dt>
<dd>Misfire: The manufacturer shall perform a test at the malfunction criteria limit
specified in section (e)(3.2.2). The testing is not required for diesel
applications.</dd>
<dt>3.6</dt>
<dd>Secondary Air System: The manufacturer shall perform a test at the low flow
limit. Manufacturers performing only a functional check in accordance with
the provisions of section (e)(5.2.2)(B) or (e)(5.2.4) shall perform a test at the
functional check flow malfunction criteria.</dd>
<dt>3.7</dt>
<dd>Catalyst System: The manufacturer shall perform a test using a catalyst
system deteriorated to the malfunction criteria using methods established by
the manufacturer in accordance with sections (e)(1.2.6) and (1.2.7). </dd>
<dt>3.8</dt>
<dd>Heated Catalyst Systems: The manufacturer shall perform a test at the
malfunction criteria limit established by the manufacturer in section (e)(2.2).</dd>
<dt>3.9</dt>
<dd>Other systems: The manufacturer shall conduct demonstration tests for all
other emission control components designed and calibrated to an emission
threshold malfunction criteria (e.g., 1.5 times any of the applicable emission
136
standards) (e.g., hydrocarbon traps, adsorbers, etc.) under the provisions of
section (e)(16).</dd>
<dt>3.10</dt>
<dd>The manufacturer may electronically simulate deteriorated components if the
manufacturer can demonstrate to the Executive Officer that the computer
modifications produce test results equivalent to an induced hardware
malfunction but may not make any vehicle control unit modifications (unless
otherwise excepted above or exempted pursuant to this section) when
performing demonstration tests. All equipment necessary to duplicate the
demonstration test must be made available to the ARB upon request.  A
manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to electronically
simulate a deteriorated component with engine control unit modifications.
The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining the
manufacturer has submitted data and/or engineering analysis demonstrating
that is technically infeasible, very difficult, and/or resource intensive to implant
the fault with modifications external to the en gine control unit.</dd>
