Except as provided below, the manufacturer shall perform single-fault testing based
on the applicable FTP test with the following components/systems set at their
malfunction criteria limits as determined by the manufacturer for meeting the
requirements of section (e):
(3.1)  Oxygen Sensors:
(3.1.1) The manufacturer shall perform a test with all primary oxygen sensors used
for fuel control simultaneously possessing a response rate deteriorated to
the malfunction criteria limit. Manufacturers shall also perform a test for any
other oxygen sensor parameter that can cause vehicle emissions to exceed
1.5 times the applicable standards (e.g., shift in air/fuel ratio at which oxygen
sensor switches, decreased amplitude, etc.). When performing additional
test(s), all primary and secondary (if applicable) oxygen sensors used for fuel
control shall be operating at the malfunction criteria limit for the applicable
66
parameter only. All other primary and secondary oxygen sensor parameters
shall be with normal characteristics.
(3.1.2)  For vehicles utilizing sensors other than oxygen sensors for primary fuel
control (e.g., linear air-fuel ratio sensors, universal sensors, etc.), the
manufacturer shall submit, for Executive Officer approval, a demonstration
test plan for performing testing of all of the sensor parameters that can cause
vehicle emissions to exceed 1.5 times the applicable standards. The
Executive Officer shall approve the plan if it is determined that it will provide
data that will assure proper performance of the diagnostics of the sensors,
consistent with the intent of section (g).
(3.2)  EGR System: The manufacturer shall perform a test at the low flow limit.
(3.3)  VVT System: For 2006 and subsequent model year Low Emission II
applications, the manufacturer shall perform a test at each target error limit and
slow response limit calibrated to the malfunction criteria (e.g., 1.5 times the FTP
standard) in sections (e)(13.2.1) and (13.2.2). In conducting the VVT system
demonstration tests, the manufacturer may use computer modifications to cause
the VVT system to operate at the malfunction limit if the manufacturer can
demonstrate that the computer modifications produce test results equivalent to
an induced hardware malfunction.
(3.4)  Fuel System:
(3.4.1)  For vehicles with adaptive feedback based on the primary fuel control
sensor(s), the manufacturer shall perform a test with the adaptive feedback
based on the primary fuel control sensor(s) at the rich limit(s) and a test at the
lean limit(s) established by the manufacturer in section (e)(6.2.1) to detect a
malfunction before emissions exceed 1.5 times the applicable standards.
(3.4.2) For vehicles with feedback based on a secondary fuel control sensor(s) and
subject to the malfunction criteria in section (e)(6.2.1), the manufacturer shall
perform a test with the feedback based on the secondary fuel control
sensor(s) at the rich limit(s) and a test at the lean limit(s) established by the
manufacturer in section (e)(6.2.1) to detect a malfunction before emissions
exceed 1.5 times the applicable standards.
(3.4.3) For other fuel metering or control systems, the manufacturer shall perform a
test at the criteria limit(s).
(3.4.4) For purposes of fuel system testing, the fault(s) induced may result in a
uniform distribution of fuel and air among the cylinders. Non -uniform
distribution of fuel and air used to induce a fault may not cause misfire. In
conducting the fuel system demonstration tests, the manufacturer may use
computer modifications to cause the fuel system to operate at the
malfunction limit if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the computer
modifications produce test results equivalent to an induced hardware
malfunction.
(3.5)  Misfire: The manufacturer shall perform a test at the malfunction criteria limit
specified in section (e)(3.2.2). The testing is not required for diesel
applications.
(3.6)  Secondary Air System: The manufacturer shall perform a test at the low flow
limit. Manufacturers performing only a functional check in accordance with the
67
provisions of section (e)(5.2.2)(B) or (e)(5.2.4) shall perform a test at the
functional check flow malfunction criteria.
(3.7)  Catalyst System: The manufacturer shall perform a test using a catalyst system
deteriorated to the malfunction criteria using methods established by the
manufacturer in accordance with section (e)(1.2.6). For diesel vehicles, the
manufacturer shall perform a test using a catalyst system deteriorated to the
malfunction criteria in sections (e)(1.5.2)(A)(i), (B)(i), or (C)(i). For diesel
vehicles with catalyst systems not subject to the malfunction criteria in section
(e)(1.5.2)(A)(i), (B)(i), or (C)(i), manufacturers are not required to perform a
catalyst demonstration test.
(3.8)  Heated Catalyst Systems: The manufacturer shall perform a test at the
malfunction criteria limit established by the manufacturer in section (e)(2.2).
(3.9)  PM Trap: The manufacturer shall perform a test using a PM trap(s) deteriorated
to the malfunction criteria in sections (e)(15.2.1) or (15.2.3). For diesel vehicles
with a PM trap(s) not subject to the malfunction criteria in section (e)(15.2.1) or
(15.2.3), manufacturers are not required to perform a PM trap(s) demonstration
test.
(3.10)  Other systems: The manufacturer shall conduct demonstration tests for all other
emission control components designed and calibrated to a malfunction criteria
of 1.5 times any of the applicable emission standards (e.g., hydrocarbon traps,
adsorbers, etc.) under the provisions of section (e)(17).
(3.11)  The manufacturer may electronically simulate deteriorated components but may
not make any vehicle control unit modifications (unless otherwise excepted
above) when performing demonstration tests. All equipment necessary to
duplicate the demonstration test must be made available to the ARB upon
request
