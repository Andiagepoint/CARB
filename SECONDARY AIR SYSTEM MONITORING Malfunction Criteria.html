<dt>5.2.1</dt>
<dd>For purposes of section (e)(5), “air flow” is defined as the air flow delivered
by the secondary air system to the exhaust system. For vehicles using
secondary air systems with multiple air flow paths/distribution points, the
air flow to each bank (i.e., a group of cylinders that share a common
exhaust manifold, catalyst, and control sensor) shall be monitored in
accordance with the malfunction criteria in sections (e)(5.2.3) and (5.2.4)
unless complete blocking of air delivery to one bank does not cause a
measurable increase in emissions.</dd>
<dt>5.2.2</dt>
<dd>For all Low Emission Vehicle I applications:
(A) Except as provided in sections (e)(5.2.2)(B) and (e)(5.2.4), the OBD II
system shall detect a secondary air system malfunction prior to a
decrease from the manufacturer's specified air flow that would cause a
vehicle's emissions to exceed 1.5 times any of the applicable FTP
standards.
(B) Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to detect a
malfunction when no detectable amount of air flow is delivered in lieu of
the malfunction criteria in section (e)(5.2.2)(A). The Executive Office shall
grant approval upon determining that deterioration of the secondary air
system is unlikely based on data and/or engineering evaluation submitted
by the manufacturer demonstrating that the materials used for the
secondary air system (e.g., air hoses, tubing, valves, connectors, etc.) are
inherently resistant to disconnection, corrosion, or other deterioration.</dd>
<dt>5.2.3</dt>
<dd>For all Low Emission Vehicle II applications and all 2009 and subsequent
model year vehicles:
(A) For 2004 and 2005 model year vehicles, manufacturers shall use the
malfunction criteria specified for Low Emission Vehicle I applications in
section (e)(5.2.2).
(B) For 2006 and subsequent model year vehicles, except as provided in
sections (e)(5.2.3)(C) and (e)(5.2.4), the OBD II system shall detect a
secondary air system malfunction prior to a decrease from the
manufacturer's specified air flow during normal operation that would
cause a vehicle's emissions to exceed 1.5 times any of the applicable
FTP standards. For purposes of sections (e)(5.2) and (5.3), “normal
operation” shall be defined as the condition when the secondary air
system is activated during catalyst and/or engine warm-up following
41
engine start and may not include the condition when the secondary air
system is intrusively turned on solely for the purpose of monitoring.
(C) For 2006 and 2007 model year vehicles only, a manufacturer may
request Executive Officer approval to detect a malfunction when no
detectable amount of air flow is delivered during normal operation in lieu
of the malfunction criteria in section (e)(5.2.3)(B) (e.g., 1.5 times the
standard) during normal operation. Executive Officer approval shall be
granted upon determining that the manufacturer has submitted data
and/or engineering analysis that demonstrate that the monitoring system
is capable of detecting malfunctions prior to a decrease from the
manufacturer's specified air flow that would cause a vehicle's emissions to
exceed 1.5 times any of the applicable FTP standards during an intrusive
operation of the secondary air system later in the same driving cycle.</dd>
<dt>5.2.4</dt>
<dd>For vehicles in which no deterioration or failure of the secondary air
system would result in a vehicle’s emissions exceeding 1.5 times any of
the applicable standards, the OBD II system shall detect a malfunction
when no detectable amount of air flow is delivered. For vehicles subject
to the malfunction criteria in section (e)(5.2.3)(B), this monitoring for no
detectable amount of air flow shall occur during normal operation of the
secondary air system.</dd>
