<dt>6.1</dt>
<dd>Motor vehicle manufacturers shall provide the  aftermarket service and repair
industry emission-related service information for all 1994 and subsequent model
year vehicles equipped with OBDII systems as set forth in  sections (f)(6.3)
through (6.5). The requirements of section (f)(6) shall supersede the service
information requirements set forth in title 13, CCR section 1968.1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>6.2</dt>
<dd>The Executive Officer shall waive the requirements of sections (f)(6.3) through
(6.5) upon determining that the ARB or U.S. EPA has adopted a service
information regulation or rule that is in effect and operative and requires motor
vehicle manufacturers to provide emission-related service information:
<ol type=A><li>of comparable or greater scope than required under these provisions;</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=2><li>in an easily accessible format and in a timeframe that is equivalent to or
exceeds the timeframes set forth below; and</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=3><li>at fair and reasonable cost.</li></ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>6.3</dt>
<dd>For all 1994 and subsequent model year vehicles equipped with an OBDII
system, manufacturers shall make readily available, at a fair and reasonable
price to the automotive repair industry, vehicle repair procedures which allow
effective emission-related diagnosis and repairs to be performed using only the
SAE J1978 generic scan tool and commonly available, non -microprocessor
based tools.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>6.4</dt>
<dd>As an alternative to publishing repair procedures required under section (f)(6.3),
a manufacturer may publish repair procedures referencing the use of
manufacturer-specific or enhanced equipment provided the manufacturer makes
available to the  aftermarket scan tool industry the information needed to
manufacture scan tools to perform the same emission-related diagnosis and
repair procedures (excluding any reprogramming) in a comparable manner as
the manufacturer-specific diagnostic scan tool.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>6.5</dt>
<dd>For all 1996 and subsequent model year vehicles, manufacturers shall make
available:
<ol type=A><li>Information to utilize the test results reported as required in section (f)(4.5)
(or title 13, CCR section 1968.1 (l)(3.0) for 1996 through 2002 model year
vehicles). The information must include a description of the test and test
result, associated fault codes with the test result, and scaling, units, and
conversion factors necessary to convert the results to engineering units.</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=2><li>A generic description of each of the diagnostics used to meet the
requirements of this regulation. The generic description must include a text
description of how the diagnostic is performed, typical enable conditions,
typical malfunction thresholds, typical monitoring time, fault codes associated
with the diagnostic, and test results (section (f)(4.5)) associated with the
diagnostic. Vehicles that have diagnostics not adequately represented by
the typical values identified above shall be specifically identified along with
the appropriate typical values.</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=3><li>Information necessary to execute each of the diagnostics used to meet the
requirements of sections (e)(1) through (e)(8). The information must include
either a description of sample driving patterns designed to be operated inuse or a written description of the conditions the vehicle needs to operate in
to execute each of the diagnostics necessary to change the readiness status
from “not complete” to “complete” for all monitors. The information shall be
able to be used to exercise all necessary monitors in a single driving cycle
as well as be able to be used to exercise the monitors to individually change
the readiness status for each specific monitor from “not complete” to
“complete”.</li></ol>
