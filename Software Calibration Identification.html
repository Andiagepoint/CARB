<dt>4.6.1</dt>
<dd>On all vehicles, a software calibration identification number (CAL ID) for
the diagnostic or emission critical powertrain control unit(s) shall be made
available through the standardized data link connector in accordance with
128
the SAE J1979 specifications.  Except as provided for in section
(g)(4.6.3), for 2009 and subsequent model year vehicles, the OBD II
system shall use a single software calibration identification number (CAL
ID) for each diagnostic or emission critical powertrain control unit(s) that
replies to a generic scan tool with a unique module address.</dd>
<dt>4.6.2</dt>
<dd>A unique CAL ID shall be used for every emission-related calibration
and/or software set having at least one bit of different data from any other
emission-related calibration and/or software set. Control units coded with
multiple emission or diagnostic calibrations and/or software sets shall
indicate a unique CAL ID for each variant in a manner that enables an off board device to determine which variant is being used by the vehicle.
Control units that utilize a strategy that will result in MIL illumination if the
incorrect variant is used (e.g., control units that contain variants for
manual and automatic transmissions but will illuminate the MIL if the
variant selected does not match the type of transmission on the vehicle)
are not required to use unique CAL IDs.</dd>
<dt>4.6.3</dt>
<dd>For 2009 and subsequent model year vehicles, manufacturers may
request Executive Officer approval to respond with more than one CAL ID
per diagnostic or emission critical powertrain control unit. Executive
Officer approval of the request shall be based on the method used by the
manufacturer to ensure each control unit will respond to a SAE J1978
scan tool with the CAL IDs in order of highest to lowest priority with
regards to areas of the software most critical to emission and OBD II
system performance.</dd>
