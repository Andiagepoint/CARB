On all vehicles, a software calibration
identification number (CAL ID) for the diagnostic or emission critical  powertrain
control unit(s) shall be made available through the standardized data link
connector in accordance with the SAE J1979 specifications. A unique CALID
shall be used for every emission-related calibration and/or software set having at
least one bit of different data from any other emission-related calibration and/or
software set. Control units coded with multiple emission or diagnostic
calibrations and/or software sets shall indicate a unique CAL ID for each variant
in a manner that enables an off-board device to determine which variant is being
used by the vehicle.  Control units that utilize a strategy that will result in MIL
illumination if the incorrect variant is used (e.g., control units that contain variants
for manual and automatic transmissions but will illuminate the MIL if the variant
selected does not match the type of transmission on the vehicle) are not
required to use unique CAL IDs.
