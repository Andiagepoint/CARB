<dt>4.7.1</dt>
<dd>All 2005 2 and subsequent model year vehicles shall use an algorithm to
calculate a calibration verification number (CVN) that verifies the on-board
computer software integrity in diagnostic or emission critical electronically
reprogrammable powertrain control units. The CVN shall be made available
through the standardized data link connector in accordance with the SAE
J1979 specifications. The CVN shall be capable of being used to determine
if the emission-related software and/or calibration data are valid and
applicable for that vehicle and CALID.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.7.2</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall request Executive Officer approval of the algorithm used
to calculate the CVN. Executive Officer approval of the algorithm shall be
based on the complexity of the algorithm and the difficulty in achieving the
same CVN with modified calibration values.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.7.3</dt>
<dd>The CVN shall be calculated at least once per driving cycle and stored until
the CVN is subsequently updated.  Except for immediately after a
reprogramming event or a non-volatile memory clear or for the first 30
seconds of engine operation after a volatile memory clear or battery
disconnect, the stored value shall be made available through the data link
connector to a generic scan tool in accordance with SAE J1979
specifications. The stored CVN value may not be erased when fault memory
is erased by a generic scan tool in accordance with SAE J1979
specifications or during normal vehicle shut down (i.e., key off, engine off).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.7.4</dt>
<dd>For purposes of Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) testing, manufacturers
shall make the CVN and CAL ID combination information available for all
2005 and subsequent model year vehicles in a standardized electronic
format that allows for off-board verification that the CVN is valid and
appropriate for a specific vehicle and CAL ID.</dd>
