When submitting an application for certification of a test group, the manufacturer
shall submit the following documentation. If any of the items listed below are
standardized for all of a manufacturer’s test groups, the manufacturer may, for
each model year, submit one set of documents covering the standardized items
for all of its test groups.
<dl>
<dt>1.1</dt>
<dd>For the required documentation not standardized across all test groups, the
manufacturer may propose to the Executive Officer that documentation
covering a specified combination of test groups be used. These
combinations shall be known as “OBD II groups”. Executive Officer approval
shall be granted for those groupings that include test groups using the same
OBD II strategies and similar calibrations. If approved by the Executive
Officer, the manufacturer may submit one set of documentation from one or
more representative test group(s) that are a part of the OBD II group. The
Executive Officer shall determine whether a selected test group(s) is
representative of the OBD II group as a whole. To be approved as
representative, the test group(s) must possess the most stringent  exhaust
emission standards and OBD II monitoring requirements and cover all of the
emission control devices within the OBD II group.</dd>
<dt>1.2</dt>
<dd>With Executive Officer approval, one or more of the documentation
requirements of section (i) may be waived or modified if the information
required would be redundant or unnecessarily burdensome to generate.</dd>
<dt>1.3</dt>
<dd>To the extent possible, the certification documentation shall use SAE J1930
terms, abbreviations, and acronyms.</dd>
