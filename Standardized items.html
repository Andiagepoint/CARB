(1)  When submitting an application for certification of a test group, the manufacturer
shall submit the following documentation. If any of the items listed below are
standardized for all of a manufacturer’s test groups, the manufacturer may, for each
model year, submit one set of documents covering the standardized items for all of
its test groups.
(1.1)  For the required documentation not standardized across all test groups, the
manufacturer may propose to the Executive Officer that documentation covering
a specified combination of test groups be used. These combinations shall be
known as “OBDII groups”. Executive Officer approval shall be granted for those
groupings that include test groups using the same OBDII strategies and similar
calibrations. If approved by the Executive Officer, the manufacturer may submit
one set of documentation from one or more representative test group(s) that are
a part of the OBDII group. The Executive Officer shall determine whether a
selected test group(s) is representative of the OBDII group as a whole. To be
approved as representative, the test group(s) must possess the most stringent
emission standards and OBDII monitoring requirements and cover all of the
emission control devices within the OBDII group.
(1.2)  With Executive Officer approval, one or more of the documentation requirements
of section (h) may be waived or modified if the information required would be
redundant or unnecessarily burdensome to generate.
(1.3)  To the extent possible, the certification documentation shall use SAE J1930
terms, abbreviations, and acronyms.
