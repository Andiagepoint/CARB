<dd>For all monitored components and systems identified in section (e)(1)
through (e)(8) except misfire detection and fuel system monitoring, results of
the most recent monitoring of the components and systems and the test
limits established for monitoring the respective components and systems
shall be stored and available through the data link in accordance with SAE
J1979 specifications.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.5.2</dt>
<dd>The test results shall be reported such that properly functioning components
and systems (e.g., “passing” systems) do not store test values outside of the
established test limits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.5.3</dt>
<dd>The test results shall be stored until updated by a more recent valid test result
or the fault memory of the OBDII system computer is cleared. Upon fault
memory being cleared, test results reported for monitors that have not yet
completed since the last time the fault memory was cleared shall report
values that do not indicate a failure (i.e., a test value which is outside of the
test limits).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4.5.4</dt>
<dd>Additionally, for vehicles using ISO 15765-4 (see section (f)(3.4)) as the
communication protocol:
<ol type=A><li>The test results and limits shall be made available in the standardized format
specified in SAE J1979 for the ISO 15765-4 protocol.</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=2><li>Test limits shall include both minimum and maximum acceptable values and
shall be reported for all monitored components and systems identified in
sections (e)(1) through (e)(8), except fuel system monitoring. The test limits
shall be defined so that a test result equal to either test limit is a “passing”
value, not a “failing” value.</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=3><li>For 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles, misfire monitoring test
results shall be calculated and reported in the standardized format specified
in SAE J1979.</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=4><li>Monitors that have not yet completed since the last time the fault memory
was cleared shall report values of zero for the test result and test limits.</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=5><li>All test results and test limits shall always be reported and the test results
shall be stored until updated by a more recent valid test result or the fault
memory of the OBDII system computer is cleared.</li></ol>
<ol type=A start=6><li>The OBDII system shall store and report unique test results for each
separate diagnostic (e.g., an OBDII system with individual evaporative
system diagnostics for 0.040 inch and 0.020 inch leaks shall separately
report 0.040 inch and 0.020 inch test results).</li></ol>
