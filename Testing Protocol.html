(4.1)  Preconditioning: The manufacturer shall use an applicable FTP cycle (or Unified
Cycle, if approved) for preconditioning test vehicles prior to conducting each of
the above emission tests.  Upon determining that a manufacturer has provided
data and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that additional
preconditioning is necessary to stabilize the emission control system, the
Executive Officer shall allow the manufacturer to perform a single additional
preconditioning cycle, identical to the initial preconditioning cycle, or a Federal
Highway Fuel Economy Driving Cycle, following a ten minute (20 minutes for
medium duty engines certified on an engine dynamometer) hot soak after the
initial preconditioning cycle. The manufacturer may not require the test vehicle to
be cold soaked prior to conducting preconditioning cycles in order for the
monitoring system testing to be successful.
(4.2)  Test Sequence:
(4.2.1)  The manufacturer shall set the system or component on the test vehicle for
which detection is to be tested at the criteria limit(s) prior to conducting the
applicable preconditioning cycle(s). If a second preconditioning cycle is
permitted in accordance with section (g)(4.1) above, the manufacturer may
adjust the system or component to be tested before conducting the second
preconditioning cycle. The manufacturer may not replace, modify, or adjust
68
the system or component after the last preconditioning cycle has taken place.
(4.2.2) After preconditioning, the test vehicle shall be operated over the applicable
FTP cycle (or Unified Cycle, if approved) to allow for the initial detection of
the tested system or component malfunction. This driving cycle may be
omitted from the testing protocol if it is unnecessary. If required by the
designated monitoring strategy, a cold soak may be performed prior to
conducting this driving cycle.
(4.2.3)  The test vehicle shall then be operated over the cold start and hot start
exhaust tests of the applicable FTP test. If monitoring during the Unified
Cycle is approved, a second Unified Cycle may be conducted prior to the
FTP test.
(4.3)  A manufacturer required to test more than one test vehicle (section (g)(2.1.2))
may utilize internal calibration sign-off test procedures (e.g., forced cool downs,
less frequently calibrated emission analyzers, etc.) instead of official FTP test
procedures to obtain the emission test data required in section (g) for all but one
of the required test vehicles. The manufacturer may elect this option if the data
from the alternative test procedure are representative of official FTP emission
test results. Manufacturers using this option are still responsible for meeting the
malfunction criteria specified in section (e) when emission tests are performed
in accordance with official FTP test procedures
