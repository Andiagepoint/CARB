<dd>Preconditioning: The manufacturer shall use an applicable cycle (FTP, SET,
or Unified Cycle) for preconditioning test vehicles prior to conducting each of
the above emission tests. Upon determining that a manufacturer has
provided data and/or an engineering evaluation that demonstrate that
additional preconditioning is necessary to stabilize the emission control
system, the Executive Officer shall allow the manufacturer to perform a single
additional preconditioning cycle, identical to the initial preconditioning cycle,
or a Federal Highway Fuel Economy Driving Cycle, following a ten minute (20
minutes for medium duty engines certified on an engine dynamometer) hot
soak after the initial preconditioning cycle. The manufacturer may not require
the test vehicle to be cold soaked prior to conducting preconditioning cycles
in order for the monitoring system testing to be successful.</dd>
<dt>5.2</dt>
<dd>Test Sequence:
<dl>
<dt>5.2.1</dt>
<dd>The manufacturer shall set the system or component on the test vehicle
for which detection is to be tested at the criteria limit(s) prior to conducting
the applicable preconditioning cycle(s). If a second preconditioning cycle
is permitted in accordance with section (h)(5.1) above, the manufacturer
may adjust the system or component to be tested before conducting the
second preconditioning cycle. The manufacturer may not replace, modify,
or adjust the system or component after the last preconditioning cycle has
taken place.</dd>
<dt>5.2.2</dt>
<dd>After preconditioning, the test vehicle shall be operated over the
applicable cycle to allow for the initial detection of the tested system or
component malfunction. This test cycle may be omitted from the testing
protocol if it is unnecessary. If required by the designated monitoring
strategy, a cold soak may be performed prior to conducting this driving
cycle.</dd>
<dt>5.2.3</dt>
<dd>The test vehicle shall then be operated over the applicable exhaust
emission test. If monitoring is designed to run during the Unified Cycle, a
second Unified Cycle may be conducted prior to the exhaust emission
test.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>5.3</dt>
<dd>A manufacturer required to test more than one test vehicle (section (h)(2.2))
may utilize internal calibration sign-off test procedures (e.g., forced cool
downs, less frequently calibrated emission analyzers, etc.) instead of official
exhaust emission test procedures to obtain the emission test data required in
section (h) for all but one of the required test vehicles. The manufacturer
may elect this option if the data from the alternative test procedure are
representative of official exhaust emission test results. Manufacturers using
this option are still responsible for meeting the malfunction criteria specified in
sections (e) and (f) when emission tests are performed in accordance with
official exhaust emission test procedures.</dd>
<dt>5.4</dt>
<dd>For medium-duty vehicles certified to an engine dynamometer exhaust
emission standard, a manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to
utilize an alternate testing protocol for demonstration of MIL illumination if the
engine dynamometer emission test cycle does not allow all of a monitor’s
enable conditions to be satisfied. A manufacturer may request the use of an
alternate engine dynamometer test cycle or the use of chassis testing to
demonstrate proper MIL illumination. In evaluating the manufacturer's
request, the Executive Officer shall consider the technical necessity for using
an alternate test cycle and the degree to which the alternate test cycle
demonstrates that in-use operation with the malfunctioning component will
properly result in MIL illumination.</dd>
