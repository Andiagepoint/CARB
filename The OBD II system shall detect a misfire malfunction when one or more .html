<dt>3.3.1</dt>
<dd>Except as provided in section (f)(3.3.2), the OBD II system shall monitor
for misfires identified in section (f)(3.2.1) during engine idle conditions at
least once per driving cycle in which the monitoring conditions for misfire
are met. A manufacturer shall submit monitoring conditions to the
Executive Officer for approval. The Executive Officer shall approve
manufacturer-defined monitoring conditions that are determined (based
on manufacturer-submitted data and/or other engineering documentation)
to: (i) be technically necessary to ensure robust detection of malfunctions
(e.g., avoid false passes and false detection of malfunctions), (ii) require
no more than 1000 cumulative engine revolutions, and (iii) do not require
any single continuous idle operation of more than 15 seconds to make a
determination that a malfunction is present (e.g., a decision can be made
with data gathered during several idle operations of 15 seconds or less);
or satisfy the requirements of (d)(3.1) with alternative engine operating
conditions.</dd>
<dt>3.3.2</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers may request Executive Officer approval to use alternate
monitoring conditions (e.g., off-idle) in lieu of the monitoring conditions
specified in section (f)(3.3.1).  The Executive Officer shall approve
alternate monitoring conditions that are determined (based on
manufacturer-submitted data and/or other engineering documentation) to
ensure equivalent robust detection of malfunctions and equivalent
timeliness in detection of malfunctions.</dd>
<dt>3.3.3</dt>
<dd>For misfires identified in section (f)(3.2.2), the OBD II system shall monitor
for misfire as follows:
<ol type=A>
<li>For passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and MDPVs certified to a chassis
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard, the OBD II system shall
continuously monitor for misfire under all positive torque engine speeds
and load conditions.</li>
<li>For medium-duty vehicles (including MDPVs) certified to an engine
dynamometer tailpipe emission standard, the OBD II system shall
continuously monitor for misfire under the following conditions:
(i) For 2010 through 2018 model year vehicles and 2019 and subsequent
model year vehicles that are not included in the phase-in specified in
section (f)(3.3.3)(B)(ii), under positive torque conditions up to75
percent of peak torque with engine speed up to 75 percent of the
maximum engine speed except within the following range: the engine
operating region bound by the positive torque line (i.e., engine torque
with transmission in neutral) and the two following points: engine
speed of 50 percent of maximum engine speed with the engine torque
at the positive torque line, and 75 percent of the maximum engine
speed with the engine torque at 5 percent of peak torque above the
positive torque line.
(ii) For 20 percent of 2019 model year, 50 percent of 2020 model year,
and 100 percent of 2021 model year medium-duty vehicles
(percentage based on the manufacturer’s projected California sales
volume for all medium-duty diesel vehicles), under all positive torque
engine speed conditions except within the following range: the engine
operating region bound by the positive torque line (i.e., engine load
with transmission in neutral) and the two following points: engine
speed of 50 percent of maximum engine speed with the engine torque
at the positive torque line, and 100 percent of the maximum engine
speed with the engine torque at 10 percent of peak torque above the
positive torque line.</li>
<li>If a monitoring system cannot detect all misfire patterns under all  required
engine speed and load conditions as required in sections (f)(3.3.3)(A) and
(B), the manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to accept
the monitoring system. In evaluating the manufacturer’s request, the
Executive Officer shall consider the following factors: the magnitude of the
region(s) in which misfire detection is limited, the degree to which misfire
detection is limited in the region(s) (i.e., the probability of detection of
misfire events), the frequency with which said region(s) are expected to be
encountered in-use, the type of misfire patterns for which misfire detection
is troublesome, demonstration that the monitoring technology employed is
not inherently incapable of detecting misfire under required conditions
(i.e., compliance can be achieved on other engines), and the extent to
which the most reliable monitoring method developed is unable to ensure
robust detection of misfire in the region(s). The evaluation shall be based
on the following misfire patterns: equally spaced misfire occurring on
randomly selected cylinders, single cylinder continuous misfire, and paired
cylinder (cylinders firing at the same crank angle) continuous misfire.</li>
<li>A manufacturer may request Executive Officer approval to disable misfire
monitoring or employ an alternate malfunction criterion when misfire
cannot be distinguished from other effects. Upon determining that the
manufacturer has presented documentation that demonstrates the
disablement interval or period of use of an alternate malfunction criterion
is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false detection, the Executive
Officer shall approve the disablement or use of the alternate malfunction
criterion. Such disablements may include but are not limited to events
involving:
(i) rough road,
(ii) fuel cut,
(iii) gear changes for manual transmission vehicles,
(iv) traction control or other vehicle stability control activation such as anti lock braking or other engine torque modifications to enhance vehicle
stability,
(v) off-board control or intrusive activation of vehicle components or
diagnostics during service or assembly plant testing,
(vi) intrusive diagnostics during portions that can significantly affect engine
stability, or
(vii) infrequent regeneration events during portions that can significantly
affect engine stability.</li>
