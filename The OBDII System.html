<dd>If a malfunction is present as specified in section s (e) and (f), the OBD II
system shall detect the malfunction, store a pending or confirmed fault code
in the onboard computer’s memory, and illuminate the MIL as required.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>1.2</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall be equipped with a standardized data link connector
to provide access to the stored fault codes as specified in section  (g).</dd>

<dl>
<dt>1.3</dt>
<dd>The OBD II system shall be designed to operate, without any required
scheduled maintenance, for the actual life of the vehicle in which it is installed
and may not be programmed or otherwise designed to deactivate based on
age and/or mileage of the vehicle during the actual life of the vehicle. This
section is not intended to alter existing law and enforcement practice
regarding a manufacturer’s liability for a vehicle beyond its useful life, except
where a vehicle has been programmed or otherwise designed so that an
OBD II system deactivates based on age and/or mileage of the vehicle.</dd>

<dd>Computer-coded engine operating parameters may not be changeable
without the use of specialized tools and procedures (e.g. soldered or potted
computer components or sealed (or soldered) computer enclosures). Subject
to Executive Officer approval, manufacturers may exempt from this
requirement those product lines that are unlikely to require protection.
Criteria to be evaluated in making an exemption include current availability of
performance chips, high performance capability of the vehicle, and sales
volume.</dd>
