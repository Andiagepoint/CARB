(3.1)  Manufacturers are required to collect and report in-use monitoring performance
data representative of every test group certified by the manufacturer and
equipped with in-use monitoring performance tracking software in accordance
with section (d)(4) to the ARB within six months from either the time vehicles in
the test group were first introduced into commerce or the start of normal
production for such vehicles, whichever is later. The manufacturer may propose
to the Executive Officer that multiple test groups be combined to collect
representative data. Executive Officer approval shall be granted upon
determining that the proposed groupings include test groups using the same
OBDII strategies and similar calibrations and that are expected to have similar
in-use monitoring performance. If approved by the Executive Officer, the
manufacturer may submit one set of data for each of the approved groupings.
(3.2)  For each test group or combination of test groups, the data must include all of
the in-use performance tracking data reported through SAE J1979 (i.e., all
numerators, denominators, and the ignition cycle counter), the date the data was
collected, the vehicle VIN, and the ECM software calibration identification
number.
(3.3)  Manufacturers shall submit a plan to the Executive Officer for review and
approval of the sampling method, number of vehicles to be sampled, time line to
collect the data, and reporting format.  The Executive Officer shall approve the
plan upon determining that it provides for effective collection of data from a
representative sample of vehicles that, at a minimum, is fifteen vehicles, will
likely result in the collection and submittal of data within the required six month
time frame, will generate data that are representative of California drivers and
78
temperatures, and does not, by design, exclude or include specific vehicles in an
attempt to collect data only from vehicles with the highest in-use performance
ratios.
(3.4)  Upon request of the manufacturer, the Executive Officer may for good cause
extend the  six month time requirement set forth in section (j)(3.1) up to a
maximum of twelve months. In granting additional time, the Executive Officer
shall consider, among other things, information submitted by the manufacturer to
justify the delay, sales volume of the test group(s), and the sampling mechanism
utilized by the manufacturer to procure vehicles. If an extension beyond six
months is granted, the manufacturer shall additionally be required to submit an
interim report within six months for data collected up to the time of the interim
report.
(3.5)  Upon request of the manufacturer, the Executive Officer may reduce the
minimum sample size of fifteen vehicles set forth in section (j)(3.3) for test
groups with low sales volume. In granting approval of a sampling plan with a
reduced minimum sample size, the Executive Officer shall consider, among
other things, information submitted by the manufacturer to justify the smaller
sample size, sales volume of the test group(s), and the sampling mechanism
utilized by the manufacturer to procure vehicles
