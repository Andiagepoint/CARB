<dt>3.1</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers are required to collect and report in-use monitoring
performance data representative of every test group certified by the
manufacturer and equipped with in-use monitoring performance tracking
software in accordance with section (d)(4) to the ARB within twelve months
from either the time vehicles in the test group were first introduced into
commerce or the start of normal production for such vehicles, whichever is
later. The manufacturer may propose to the Executive Officer that multiple
test groups be combined to collect representative data. Executive Officer
approval shall be granted upon determining that the proposed groupings
include test groups using the same OBD II strategies and similar calibrations
and that are expected to have similar in-use monitoring performance. If
approved by the Executive Officer, the manufacturer may submit one set of
data for each of the approved groupings.</dd>
<dt>3.2</dt>
<dd>For each test group or combination of test groups, the data must include all of
the in-use performance tracking data reported through SAE J1979 (i.e., all
numerators, denominators, and the ignition cycle counter), the date the data
was collected, the odometer reading, the vehicle VIN, and the ECM software
calibration identification number and be in the standardized format detailed in
Attachment D: Rate Based Data of ARB Mail-Out #06-23, December 21,
2006, incorporated by reference.</dd>
<dt>3.3</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall submit a plan to the Executive Officer for review and
approval of the sampling method, number of vehicles to be sampled, time line
to collect the data, and reporting format. The Executive Officer shall approve
the plan upon determining that it provides for effective collection of data from
a representative sample of vehicles that, at a minimum, is fifteen vehicles, will
likely result in the collection and submittal of data within the required  twelve
month time frame, will generate data that are representative of California
drivers and temperatures, and does not, by design, exclude or include
specific vehicles in an attempt to collect data only from vehicles with the
highest in-use performance ratios.</dd>
<dt>3.4</dt>
<dd>Upon request of the manufacturer, the Executive Officer may reduce the
minimum sample size of fifteen vehicles set forth in section (j)(3.3) for test
groups with low sales volume. In granting approval of a sampling plan with a
reduced minimum sample size, the Executive Officer shall consider, among
other things, information submitted by the manufacturer to justify the smaller
sample size, sales volume of the test group(s), and the sampling mechanism
utilized by the manufacturer to procure vehicles.  In lieu of defining a fixed
minimum sample size for low sales volume test groups, sampling plans
approved for collection of data on higher sales volume test groups under
section (j)(3.3) shall also be approved by the Executive Officer for low sales
test groups if they use the identical sampling mechanism to procure vehicles
from the low sales volume test groups.</dd>
