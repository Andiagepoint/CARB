<dt>2.1</dt>
<dd>For 2004 and subsequent model year vehicles, within the first six months
after normal production begins, manufacturers shall conduct a complete
evaluation of the OBD II system of one or more production vehicles (test
vehicles) and submit the results of the evaluation to the Executive Officer.</dd>
<dt>2.2</dt>
<dd>Selection of test vehicles:
<dl>
<dt>2.2.1</dt>
<dd>Prior to submitting any applications for certification for a model year, a
manufacturer shall notify the Executive Officer of the test groups planned
for that model year. The Executive Officer will then select the t est
group(s), in accordance with sections (j)(2.2.2) and (j)(2.2.3) below, that
the manufacturer shall use as test vehicles to provide evaluation test
results. This selection process may take place during durability
demonstration test vehicle selection specified in section (h).</dd>
<dt>2.2.2</dt>
<dd>A manufacturer shall evaluate one production vehicle per test group
selected for monitoring system demonstration in section (h).</dd>
<dt>2.2.3</dt>
<dd>In addition to the vehicles selected in section (j)(2.2.2) above, a
manufacturer shall evaluate vehicles chosen from test groups that are not
selected for monitoring system demonstration testing under section (h).
The number of additional vehicles to be tested shall be equal to the
number of vehicles selected for monitoring system demonstration in
section (h).</dd>
<dt>2.2.4</dt>
<dd>The Executive Officer may waive the requirements for submittal of
evaluation results from one or more of the test groups if data has been
previously submitted for all of the test groups.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>2.3</dt>
<dd>Evaluation requirements:
<dl>
<dt>2.3.1</dt>
<dd>The evaluation shall demonstrate the ability of the OBD II system on the
selected production vehicle to detect a malfunction, illuminate the MIL,
and store a confirmed fault code when a malfunction is present and the
monitoring conditions have been satisfied for each individual diagnostic
required by title 13, CCR section 1968.2.</dd>
<dt>2.3.2</dt>
<dd>The evaluation shall verify that malfunctions detected by non-MIL
illuminating diagnostics of components used to enable any other OBD  II
system diagnostic (e.g., fuel level sensor) will not inhibit the ability of other
OBD II system diagnostics to properly detect malfunctions.</dd>
<dt>2.3.3</dt>
<dd>On vehicles so equipped, the evaluation shall verify that the software used
to track the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining in use monitoring frequency correctly increments as required in section
(d)(4)(i.e., the “dynamic” testing portion of SAE J1699-3).</dd>
<dt>2.3.4</dt>
<dd>Malfunctions may be mechanically implanted or electronically simulated
but internal on-board computer hardware or software changes may not be
used to simulate malfunctions. Emission testing to confirm that the
malfunction is detected before the appropriate malfunction threshold (e.g.,
1.5 times the applicable standards) is exceeded is not required.</dd>
<dt>2.3.5</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall submit a proposed test plan for Executive Officer
approval prior to evaluation testing being performed. The test plan shall
identify the method used to induce a malfunction in each diagnostic. If the
Executive Officer determines that the requirements of section (j)(2) are
satisfied, the proposed test plan shall be approved.</dd>
<dt>2.3.6</dt>
<dd>Subject to Executive Officer approval, manufacturers may omit
demonstration of specific diagnostics. The Executive Officer shall
approve a manufacturer's request if the demonstration cannot be
reasonably performed without causing physical damage to the vehicle
(e.g., on-board computer internal circuit faults).</dd>
<dt>2.3.7</dt>
<dd>For evaluation of test vehicles selected in accordance with section
(j)(2.2.2), manufacturers are not required to demonstrate diagnostics that
were previously demonstrated prior to certification as required in section
(h).</dd>
</dl>
 </dd>
<dt>2.4</dt>
<dd>Manufacturers shall submit a report of the results of all testing conducted
pursuant to section (j)(2) to the Executive Officer for review. This report shall
identify the method used to induce a malfunction in each diagn ostic, the MIL
illumination status, and the confirmed fault code(s) stored.</dd>
<dt>2.5</dt>
<dd>In accordance with section (k)(6), manufacturers may request Executive
Officer approval for a retroactive deficiency to be granted for items identified
during this testing.</dd>
