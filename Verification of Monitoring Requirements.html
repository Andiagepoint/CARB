(2.1)  For 2004 and subsequent model year vehicles, within the first six months after
normal production begins, manufacturers shall conduct a complete evaluation of
the OBDII system of one or more production vehicles (test vehicles) and submit
the results of the evaluation to the Executive Officer.
(2.2)  Selection of test vehicles:
(2.2.1) Prior to submitting any applications for certification for a model year, a
manufacturer shall notify the Executive Officer of the test groups planned for
that model year. The Executive Officer will then select the test group(s), in
accordance with sections (j)(2.2.2) and (j)(2.2.3) below, that the manufacturer
shall use as test vehicles to provide evaluation test results. This selection
process may take place during  durability demonstration test vehicle selection
specified in section (g).
(2.2.2) A manufacturer shall evaluate one production vehicle per test group selected
for monitoring system demonstration in section (g).
(2.2.3)  In addition to the vehicles selected in section (j)(2.2.2) above, a manufacturer
shall evaluate vehicles chosen from test groups that are not selected for
monitoring system demonstration testing under section (g). The number of
additional vehicles to be tested shall be equal to the number of vehicles
selected for monitoring system demonstration in section (g).
(2.2.4) The Executive Officer may waive the requirements for submittal of evaluation
results from one or more of the test groups if data has been previously
submitted for all of the test groups.
(2.3)  Evaluation requirements:
(2.3.1) The evaluation shall demonstrate the ability of the OBDII system on the
selected production vehicle to detect a malfunction, illuminate the MIL, and
store a confirmed fault code when a malfunction is present and the
monitoring conditions have been satisfied for each individual diagnostic
required by title 13, CCR section 1968.2.
(2.3.2) The evaluation shall verify that malfunctions detected by non-MIL illuminating
diagnostics of components used to enable any other OBDII system
diagnostic (e.g., fuel level sensor) will not inhibit the ability of other OBDII
system diagnostics to properly detect malfunctions.
(2.3.3) On vehicles so equipped, the evaluation shall verify that the software used to
track the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining in-use
monitoring frequency correctly increments as required in section (d)(4).
(2.3.4)  Malfunctions may be mechanically implanted or electronically simulated but
internal on-board computer hardware or software changes may not be used
to simulate malfunctions. Emission testing to confirm that the malfunction is
detected before the appropriate emission standards are exceeded is not
required.
77
(2.3.5)  Manufacturers shall submit a proposed test plan for Executive Officer
approval prior to evaluation testing being performed. The test plan shall
identify the method used to induce a malfunction in each diagnostic. If the
Executive Officer determines that the requirements of section (j)(2) are
satisfied, the proposed test plan shall be approved.
(2.3.6)  Subject to Executive Officer approval, manufacturers may omit
demonstration of specific diagnostics. The Executive Officer shall approve a
manufacturer's request if the demonstration cannot be reasonably performed
without causing physical damage to the vehicle (e.g., on-board computer
internal circuit faults).
(2.3.7)  For evaluation of test vehicles selected in accordance with section (j)(2.2.2),
manufacturers are not required to demonstrate diagnostics that were
previously demonstrated prior to certification as required in section (g).
(2.4)  Manufacturers shall submit a report of the results of all testing conducted
pursuant to section (j)(2) to the Executive Officer for review. This report shall
identify the method used to induce a malfunction in each diagnostic, the MIL
illumination status, and the confirmed fault code(s) stored.
(2.5)  In accordance with section (i)(6), manufacturers may request Executive Officer
approval for a retroactive deficiency to be granted for items identified during this
testing.
