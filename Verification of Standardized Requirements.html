<dd>Requirement: For 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles, manufacturers
shall perform testing to verify that all vehicles meet the requirements of
section (g)(3) and (g)(4) relevant to proper communication of required
emission-related messages to an SAE J1978 scan tool.</dd>
<dt>1.2</dt>
<dd>Selection of Test Vehicles: Manufacturers shall perform this testing every
model year on one production vehicle from every unique calibration within  two
months of the start of normal production for that calibration. Manufacturers
may request Executive Officer approval to group multiple calibrations together
and test one representative calibration per group. The Executive Officer shall
approve the request upon finding that the software designed to comply with
the standardization requirements of section  (g) in the representative
calibration vehicle is identical (e.g., communication protocol message timing,
number of supported data stream parameters, etc.) to all others in the group
and that any differences in the calibrations are not relevant with respect to
meeting the criteria in section (j)(1.4).</dd>
<dt>1.3</dt>
<dd>Test Equipment: For the testing required in section (j)(1), manufacturers shall
utilize an off-board device to conduct the testing. Prior to conducting testing,
manufacturers are required to request and receive Executive Officer approval
of the off-board device that the manufacturer will use to perform the testing.
The Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the
manufacturer has submitted data, specifications, and/or engineering analysis
that demonstrate that the off -board device meets the minimum requirements
to conduct testing according to SAE J1699-3 using the software developed
and maintained for the SAE J1699-3 committee and available through
www.sourceforge.net and SAE J2534 compliant hardware configured
specifically for SAE J1699-3 testing.</dd>
<dt>1.4</dt>
<dd>Required Testing (i.e., “static” testing portion of SAE J1699-3):
<dl>
<dt>1.4.1</dt>
<dd>The testing shall verify that the vehicle can properly establish
communications between all emission-related on-board computers and
any SAE J1978 scan tool designed to adhere strictly to the
communication protocols allowed in section (g)(3);</dd>
<dt>1.4.2</dt>
<dd>The testing shall further verify that the vehicle can properly communicate
to any SAE J1978 scan tool:
<ol type=A>
<li>The current readiness status from all on-board computers required to
support readiness status in accordance with SAE J1979 and section
(g)(4.1) while the engine is running;</li>
<li>The MIL command status while the MIL is commanded off and while the
MIL is commanded on in accordance with SAE J1979 and section (g)(4.2)
while the engine is running, and in accordance with SAE J1979 and
sections (d)(2.1.2) during the MIL functional check and, if applicable,
(g)(4.1.3) during the MIL readiness status check while the engine is off;</li>
<li>All data stream parameters required in section (g)(4.2) in accordance with
SAE J1979 including the identification of each data stream parameter as
supported in SAE J1979 (e.g., Mode/Service $01, PID $00);</li>
<li>The CAL ID, CVN, and VIN (if applicable) in accordance with SAE J1979
and sections (g)(4.6) through (4.8);</li>
<li>An emission-related fault code (permanent, confirmed, and pending) in
accordance with SAE J1979 (including correctly indicating the number of
stored fault codes (e.g., Mode/Service $01, PID $01, Data A)) and section
(g)(4.4);</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>1.4.3</dt>
<dd>The testing shall also verify that the vehicle can properly respond to any
SAE J1978 scan tool request to clear emission-related fault codes and
reset readiness status.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>1.5</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>1.5.1</dt>
<dd>The manufacturer shall notify the Executive Officer within one month of
identifying any vehicle that does not meet the requirements  of section
(j)(1.4). The manufacturer shall submit a written report of the problem(s)
identified and propose corrective action (if any) to remedy the problem(s)
to the Executive Officer for approval. Factors to be considered by the
Executive Officer in approving the proposed corrective action shall include
the severity of the problem(s), the ability of the vehicle to be tested in an
I/M program, the ability of service technicians to access the required
diagnostic information, the impact on equipment and tool manufacturers,
and the amount of time prior to implementation of the proposed corrective
action.</dd>
<dt>1.5.2</dt>
<dd>Within three months of any passing testing conducted pursuant to section
(j)(1), a manufacturer shall submit a report of the results to the Executive
Officer for review.</dd>
<dt>1.5.3</dt>
<dd>In accordance with section (k)(6), manufacturers may request Executive
Officer approval for a retroactive deficiency to be granted for items
identified during this testing.</dd>
