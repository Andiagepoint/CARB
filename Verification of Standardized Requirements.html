(1.1)  Requirement: For 2005 and subsequent model year vehicles, manufacturers
shall perform testing to verify that all vehicles meet the requirements of section
(f)(3) and (f)(4) relevant to proper communication of required emission-related
messages to an SAE J1978 scan tool.
(1.2)  Selection of Test Vehicles: Manufacturers shall perform this testing every model
year on one production vehicle from every unique calibration within one month of
the start of normal production for that calibration. Manufacturers may request
Executive Officer approval to group multiple calibrations together and test one
representative calibration per group.  The Executive Officer shall approve the
request upon finding that the software designed to comply with the
standardization requirements of section (f) in the representative calibration
vehicle is identical (e.g., communication protocol message timing, number of
supported data stream parameters, etc.) to all others in the group and that any
differences in the calibrations are not relevant with respect to meeting the
criteria in section (j)(1.4).
(1.3)  Test Equipment: For the testing required in section (j)(1), manufacturers shall
utilize an off-board device to conduct the testing. Prior to conducting testing,
manufacturers are required to request and receive Executive Officer approval of
the off-board device that the manufacturer will use to perform the testing.  The
75
Executive Officer shall approve the request upon determining that the
manufacturer has submitted data, specifications, and/or engineering analysis
that demonstrate that the off-board device will verify vehicles will be able to
perform all of the required functions in section (j)(1.4) with any other off-board
device designed and built in accordance with the SAE J1978 generic scan tool
specifications.
(1.4)  Required Testing:
(1.4.1) The testing shall verify that the vehicle can properly establish communications
between all emission-related on-board computers and any SAE J1978 scan
tool designed to adhere strictly to the communication protocols allowed in
section (f)(3);
(1.4.2) The testing shall further verify that the vehicle can properly communicate to
any SAE J1978 scan tool:
(A)  The current readiness status from all on-board computers required to
support readiness status in accordance with SAE J1979 and section (f)(4.1)
while the engine is running;
(B)  The MIL command status while the MIL is commanded off and while the MIL
is commanded on in accordance with SAE J1979 and section (f)(4.2) while
the engine is running, and in accordance with SAE J1979 and sections
(d)(2.1.2) during the MIL functional check and, if applicable, (f)(4.1.3) during
the MIL readiness status check while the engine is off;
(C)  All data stream parameters required in section (f)(4.2) in accordance with
SAE J1979 including the identification of each data stream parameter as
supported in SAE J1979 (e.g., Mode/Service $01, PID $00);
(D)  The CAL ID, CVN, and VIN (if applicable) in accordance with SAE J1979
and sections (f)(4.6) through (4.8);
(E)  An emission-related fault code (both confirmed and pending) in accordance
with SAE J1979 (including correctly indicating the number of stored fault
codes (e.g., Mode/Service $01, PID $01, Data A)) and section (f)(4.4);
(1.4.3) The testing shall also verify that the vehicle can properly respond to any SAE
J1978 scan tool request to clear emission-related fault codes and reset
readiness status.
(1.5)  Reporting of Results:
(1.5.1)  The manufacturer shall notify the Executive Officer within one month of
identifying any vehicle that does not meet the requirements of section (j)(1.4).
The manufacturer shall submit a written report of the problem(s) identified
and propose corrective action (if any) to remedy the problem(s) to the
Executive Officer for approval. Factors to be considered by the Executive
Officer in approving the proposed corrective action shall include the severity
of the problem(s), the ability of the vehicle to be tested in an I/M program, the
ability of service technicians to access the required diagnostic information,
the impact on equipment and tool manufacturers, and the amount of time
prior to implementation of the proposed corrective action.
(1.5.2)  Upon request of the Executive Officer, a manufacturer shall submit a report of
the results of any testing conducted pursuant to section (j)(1) to the Executive
Officer for review.
76
(1.5.3)  In accordance with section (i)(6), manufacturers may request Executive
Officer approval for a retroactive deficiency to be granted for items identified
during this testing.
